  "analogy": "I used an analogy based on the consistent structural changes observed when substituting Sb -> As in related M(EO3)2 (E = Sb, As) compounds. Specifically: Sb2PbO6 : As2PbO6 :: {M(SbO3)2 : M(AsO3)2} for M = Sr, Ca, Hg, Cd, Mn. For those five M the a lattice parameter contracts by a very consistent factor (~0.922), while c increases slightly (~1.0158). The volume scales approximately as a_ratio^2 * c_ratio (~0.8636). I applied these averaged scale factors to the known Sb2PbO6 cell (a = 5.319425593245637, c = 5.38058013, volume = 131.85275606955437) to predict As2PbO6. Steps: (1) compute average a_ratio and c_ratio from the Sb/As pairs (giving a_ratio ≈ 0.9220032, c_ratio ≈ 1.0157694); (2) scale Sb2PbO6 a and c by those ratios to get a ≈ 4.904527419 and c ≈ 5.465428888; (3) compute volume using the same hexagonal (a=b) cell convention used in the dataset: V = (sqrt(3)/2) * a^2 * c, yielding V ≈ 113.867. This analogy assumes As substitutes for Sb with similar local structural response as seen across the M(SbO3)2 -> M(AsO3)2 series, and that the Pb-based compound follows the same contraction/expansion trends.",

To estimate how replacing Pd by a larger metal (Pb) changes the cell, I measured the fractional changes in a and c observed when Pd is replaced by other larger metals in the provided dataset (Pd -> Cd and Pd -> Hg). I averaged those fractional change factors to get a conservative expansion factor for a and c, and applied those averaged factors to the As2PdO6 lattice parameters to predict the As2PbO6 lattice. Finally I computed the unit-cell volume using the same hexagonal/trigonal volume formula used for the dataset (V = (sqrt(3)/2) * a^2 * c). Steps: 1) take As2PdO6 (a=4.847672232932376, c=4.675983700000269) as the reference; 2) compute Pd->Cd and Pd->Hg fractional factors for a and c; 3) average those factors to get expansion factors; 4) apply averaged factors to the Pd-based cell to predict Pb-based a and c; 5) compute V = (sqrt(3)/2) * a^2 * c. This yields a modest expansion of a and a larger expansion of c (as seen in the dataset for heavier metals), producing the predicted lattice and volume below.
