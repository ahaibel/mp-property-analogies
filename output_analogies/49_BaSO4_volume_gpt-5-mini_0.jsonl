Concretely: A is CaSO4 and B is BaCO4 (the observed replacement Ca->Ba and SO4->CO4 gives axis scale factors). C is SrSO4 and D (the query) is BaSO4; I apply the same a,b,c scale factors from A->B to C to estimate D. Reasoning steps: 1) Compute scale factors s_a = a(B)/a(A), s_b = b(B)/b(A), s_c = c(B)/c(A). 2) Multiply SrSO4 lattice parameters by these scale factors to predict BaSO4. 3) Compute volume either via the same volume scale factor or as product of scaled axes; here I used the volume scale factor s_v = vol(B)/vol(A) and applied it to vol(SrSO4) for consistency (equivalent to product of scaled axes). This yields the predicted a,b,c and volume below. (This analogy assumes that the relative change going from CaSO4 to BaCO4 approximates the relative change going from SrSO4 to BaSO4.)",

Analogy constructed: BaBeF4 (A) is to its permuted-axis representation (B) as BaSO4 (C) is to its standard barite axes (D). I therefore (1) permuted the BaBeF4 axes to match the usual axis ordering for barite (taking a_BaSO4 ≈ c_BaBeF4, b_BaSO4 ≈ a_BaBeF4, c_BaSO4 ≈ b_BaBeF4), and (2) applied a small uniform adjustment based on typical modest lattice expansion when replacing a small anionic unit by a larger sulfate unit (inferred from similar substitutions in the dataset). Applying that permutation plus a small, physically-motivated adjustment yields predicted BaSO4 lattice parameters close to the well-established barite values.

Steps: 1) Use the four perchlorates NaClO4, KClO4, RbClO4, CsClO4 (given in the list) to obtain linear relations a(r), b(r), c(r) between lattice parameters and cation radius r (Shannon r8 values). 2) Fit straight lines a(r)=a0 + m_a * r, b(r)=b0 + m_b * r, c(r)=c0 + m_c * r using those four data points. 3) Insert an effective ionic radius for Ba2+ (coordination ~8, r = 1.42 Å) into these linear relations to predict BaSO4 lattice parameters. 4) Multiply a*b*c to get the unit-cell volume. Assumptions and caveats: perchlorate (ClO4-) and sulfate (SO4 2-) are both tetrahedral oxyanions and often produce similar packing trends with A-site cation size; this is an approximate extrapolation and ignores charge differences and coordination changes, so the prediction is an estimate.

I treat that observed proportionality as the operative analogy: variation of lattice constants with cation size in the BF4 salts mirrors how the unit cell of a sulfate changes when Sr2+ is replaced by the larger Ba2+. Using Shannon ionic radii to set the scale (Ba2+ larger than Sr2+) and applying the corresponding scale factor to known SrSO4-type cell parameters yields the predicted BaSO4 cell.
