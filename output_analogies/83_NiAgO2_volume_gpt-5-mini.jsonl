  "analogy": "I use the systematic change when replacing Au by Ag in AAuO2 -> AAgO2 as the analogy. Concretely: (AAuO2 is to AAgO2) as (NiAuO2 is to NiAgO2). I computed Au->Ag scale factors for a and c from six element pairs where both AAuO2 and AAgO2 are present (Al, Ga, Co, Tl, La, Y). The averaged scale factors are a_Ag/a_Au ≈ 0.98926 and c_Ag/c_Au ≈ 1.01711. Applying these to the known NiAuO2 cell (a = 2.954328882 Å, c = 12.06804777 Å) gives a_pred = 2.954328882 * 0.9892577 ≈ 2.922585 Å and c_pred = 12.06804777 * 1.017107 ≈ 12.274495 Å. I then computed the hexagonal-cell volume using V = (sqrt(3)/2) * a^2 * c to get V ≈ 90.7995 Å^3. Assumptions: (1) Ni in NiAgO2 adopts the same structural type as NiAuO2 (hexagonal delafossite-like with a=b), (2) Au->Ag substitution produces similar fractional changes across A, so averaged scale factors are applicable to Ni. Potential uncertainty is on the order of a few tenths of an Å in c and a few percent in volume.",

Ag layers (as in AgNiO2-like layered oxides) are relatively large and O2 anions form compact NiO2 layers, which typically yield a basal a around 2.8–3.0 Å and an interlayer c in the ~12 Å range (delafossite/related layered oxides).  \n3) Therefore I use the NiCN2 -> NiOsN2 change as an analogy: replacing the simpler nitride stacking by a larger interlayer/stacking motif increases c by a few Å while a remains near 2.9 Å.

To predict lattice parameters I use a closely analogous oxide in the provided list that has a comparable layered delafossite-like geometry and known a, c: LiNb2O (a = 2.8763 Å, c = 16.7614 Å). The mapping is:\n\nLiNb2O : (Li -> Ag, Nb -> Ni) :: NiAgO2 : (target)\n\nReasoning and scaling assumptions:\n- The in-plane lattice parameter a is set by the B–O (Ni–O) triangular lattice. Replacing Nb by Ni slightly reduces the B–O bond length (Ni is slightly smaller than Nb), which tends to reduce a. Replacing Li by Ag (interlayer) has only a modest influence on the in-plane lattice parameter. Net effect: a is expected to be very close to LiNb2O’s a, with a small upward correction because Ag is a larger interlayer cation and slightly relaxes the Ni–O network.\n- The c lattice parameter is sensitive to the interlayer spacing (size of the A cation and stacking). Replacing small Li by larger Ag increases the interlayer spacing, so c should increase modestly relative to LiNb2O.\n\nI therefore apply modest empirical scale factors to LiNb2O parameters: a_scale ≈ 1.015 (≈ +1.5%) and c_scale ≈ 1.02 (≈ +2%).

Step 2: Replacing N (a small anion) by O (a larger anion) in comparable compounds (compare nitride vs oxide examples such as NiOsN2 and LiNb2O) tends to increase c substantially and modestly increase a. Step 3: Replacing the transition metal Os by the larger, softer Ag should increase a further (Ag has a larger metallic radius than Os) and also push c upward because of the larger Ag–O separation and the O anion. Combining these trends (apply the qualitative direction and moderate magnitude of changes observed in the NiCN2 -> NiOsN2 substitution, then bias toward larger a and larger c to account for Ag and O): I increase a relative to NiOsN2 by roughly +6.6% (from 2.8631 → ~3.05) and increase c relative to NiOsN2 by roughly +25% (from 12.163 → ~15.2).

(2) Use LiNb2O (an oxide in the list with a = 2.87631 Å, c = 16.761415 Å) as an example (B) of how lattice parameters change when going from a sulfide-type compound to an oxide-type compound in this materials family. From these two real entries we derive empirical scale factors for S -> O substitution: a_scale = a_oxide / a_sulfide = 2.87631 / 3.22409 = 0.892, c_scale = c_oxide / c_sulfide = 16.761415 / 15.02323 = 1.115. (3) Apply those empirical scale factors to the VAuS2 proxy (C) to predict the target oxide (D = NiAgO2): a_D = a_VAuS2 * a_scale, c_D = c_VAuS2 * c_scale. This assumes that the dominant systematic change coming from replacing S by O is similar across these layered/noble-metal-containing compounds. (4) Compute the hexagonal cell volume with V = (sqrt(3)/2) * a^2 * c.
