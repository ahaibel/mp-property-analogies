  "analogy": "I used an ion-substitution analogy among closely related quaternary chloride structures. Reasoning steps: (1) Start from known A-site trends for the GaCl4 framework: replacing K+ with the larger Rb+ or Cs+ typically makes formation energies slightly less negative (weaker lattice stabilization) by a few hundredths of an eV/atom. (2) Compare composition isostructural series: KGaCl4 and CsGaCl4 set the cation trend for GaCl4 units; RbAlCl4 shows the effect of changing the trivalent cation (Al→Ga) for the same A-site. (3) Combine trends: take the K→Rb shift (small negative change toward less negative formation energy) observed between KGaCl4 and RbGaCl4 analogs, and the Al→Ga shift (slightly less negative when going from Al to Ga) observed between RbAlCl4 and RbGaCl4 analogs. (4) Average these adjustments to predict RbGaCl4. Concretely: using representative analogs (KGaCl4 ≈ -1.05 eV/atom, CsGaCl4 ≈ -1.00 eV/atom, RbAlCl4 ≈ -1.12 eV/atom) gives an expected value for RbGaCl4 slightly more negative than KGaCl4 but less negative than RbAlCl4; combining these trends yields ≈ -1.09 eV/atom.
