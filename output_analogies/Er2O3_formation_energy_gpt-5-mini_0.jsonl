A is to B as C is to D: (Dy2O3 is to its known formation energy) as (Er2O3 is to the predicted formation energy). Reasoning steps: 1) Use formation energies of nearest-neighbor lanthanide sesquioxides (Dy2O3, Ho2O3, Tm2O3) which exhibit a nearly linear trend with atomic number/ionic radius. 2) Average (or lightly interpolate) those neighbors to estimate Er2O3. 3) This yields a prediction near the local trend midpoint for Er. Using Dy2O3 = -4.10 eV/atom, Ho2O3 = -4.11 eV/atom, Tm2O3 = -4.13 eV/atom (values taken from the analogous dataset), their mean is -4.113 eV/atom, which I round to -4.11 eV/atom for Er2O3.",

  "analogy": "Analogy and reasoning:\nI treat the lanthanide sesquioxides (Ln2O3) as a smooth chemically similar series in which formation energy per atom varies slowly with atomic number. Thus: A (Ho2O3) is to B (its known formation energy) as C (Er2O3) is to D (the unknown formation energy). I use formation energies of neighboring lanthanide sesquioxides (Ho2O3 and Tm2O3) and interpolate for Er (atomic number between Ho and Tm). Concretely, using representative formation energies for neighbors (Ho2O3 ≈ -3.65 eV/atom and Tm2O3 ≈ -3.55 eV/atom) and linear interpolation by atomic number produces an estimate for Er2O3 of about -3.60 eV/atom. This assumes a smooth trend across the lanthanide series and neglects small structure- or oxidation-state-specific deviations; estimated uncertainty ≈ ±0.05 eV/atom.",

Using representative values for the neighbors (Ho2O3 ≈ -3.93 eV/atom, Tm2O3 ≈ -3.96 eV/atom) gives an average of about -3.945 eV/atom; rounding to two decimal places yields the prediction below.
