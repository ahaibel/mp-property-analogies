  "analogy": "I use a cation-substitution analogy (K -> Rb) on the same M site to estimate properties. Concretely: K2NiF6 is to Rb2NiF6 as K2CoF6 is to Rb2CoF6. Rationale: the dataset contains both K- and Rb-containing compounds for the same transition metal (Ni) so the measured change on going K->Rb for Ni should approximate the change when going K->Rb for Co (same A-site size effect). Steps: (1) compute the difference K2NiF6 -> Rb2NiF6 for each property: band gap +0.0613 eV, formation energy per atom -0.005299 eV/atom (slightly more negative), lattice a-scale factor = 8.359146094859796/8.002589366977142 ≈ 1.04458 (volume scale factor ≈ 1.1398075). (2) apply those changes to K2CoF6 (the known Co entry) to predict Rb2CoF6: band gap = 1.1713 + 0.0613 = 1.2326 eV; formation energy = -2.467351918277778 + (-0.005299206722223) = -2.472651125 ≈ -2.47265 eV/atom; lattice parameters scaled by 1.04458 (a=b: 5.695227378872455 * 1.04458 ≈ 5.94910 Å, c: 7.920952919999998 * 1.04458 ≈ 8.27320 Å) and volume scaled by 1.1398075 (256.9209785308503 * 1.1398075 ≈ 292.852 Å^3). Assumptions/uncertainties: this uses the observed K->Rb structural and energetic shifts for Ni as a proxy for Co; it assumes the A-site size effect dominates and that any electronic differences between Ni and Co produce smaller systematic errors. Expect uncertainty of a few 0.1 eV in band gap and a few 0.01 eV/atom in formation energy and a few percent in lattice/volume.",

(2) From the provided data: K2CoF6 has band gap = 1.1713 eV, formation energy ≈ -2.46735 eV/atom, a = 5.6952 Å, c = 7.92095 Å (tetragonal-like cell), volume = 256.921 Å3.

(3) Ionic-radius interpolation (K+ → Rb+ → Cs+) suggests Rb will have lattice parameters intermediate between K and Cs. Formation energy varies little between K and Cs (difference ~0.006 eV/atom), so Rb should be very close to that value. (4) Band gap shows a drop from K (1.17 eV) to Cs (0.0 eV); Rb is expected to be intermediate (reduced gap relative to K but likely nonzero). (5) I interpolate lattice parameters roughly linearly between the K and Cs (equivalent single-formula-cell values) to obtain a=b≈5.97 Å and c≈7.79 Å, giving a cell volume ≈278 Å3. (6) Formation energy taken as the average/typical value for the A=K,Cs pair → ≈ -2.471 eV/atom. (7) Band gap chosen intermediate but biased toward smaller values because Cs is metallic/zero-gap; predicted band gap ≈0.6 eV for Rb2CoF6.

Reasoning steps: (1) All compounds share the same A-site cation (Rb) and F6 octahedral framework, so lattice parameter and volume are expected to lie close to other Rb2MF6 entries. (2) Electronic trends for M4+ series show that band gap varies with d electron count but not strongly with the A-site (K/Rb/Cs give similar gaps). Mn4+ (d3) and Ni4+ (d6) give gaps of ~3.30 and ~2.42 eV respectively; Co4+ (d5) typically has electronic structure between those cases and often gives a substantial gap (d5 can be more insulating than d2/d1). Therefore the band gap for Co4+ is estimated between the Mn and Ni values, closer to Mn4+ due to half-filled stability — chosen ~3.05 eV. (3) Formation energies for Rb2MF6 transition-metal examples cluster between about -2.4 and -3.1 eV/atom; early-to-mid 3d metals (V, Cr, Mn) are more negative (~-3.0) while late 3d (Ni, Cu) are somewhat less negative (~-2.3 to -2.4). Co (mid-late 3d) is expected to have stability comparable to Mn/Cr but slightly less negative than the most negative values, so a reasonable estimate is -2.85 eV/atom.

  "analogy": "Analogy used: Rb2MnCl6 is to Rb2MnF6 as Rb2CoCl6 is to Rb2CoF6.

(2) Use known chemical trends for halide substitution: replacing Cl by the smaller, more electronegative F typically reduces the lattice parameter (smaller anion radius) and increases the band gap (stronger B–X bonding, larger crystal-field/splitting and deeper anion states). Data in the set (Cl → I examples such as Cs2TiCl6 to Cs2TiI6) show sizeable lattice shifts with halide changes; by analogy the Cl → F change should move in the opposite direction (smaller a) by a comparable absolute amount (on the order of ~0.6–1.0 Å for these A2BX6 systems). (3) Account for B-site substitution (Mn → Co): across transition metals in similar coordination Co-based halides generally give comparable or modestly larger band gaps than Mn-based ones (based on other B-site variations in the list). Thus start from Rb2MnCl6 and (a) shrink a modest amount to model Cl→F, and (b) increase the band gap moderately to account for Co vs Mn and increased electronegativity of F. (4) Formation-energy trend: halides with more strongly bonding anions (F) are typically more stable (more negative formation energy) than Cl analogues; likewise transition-metal substitution to a reasonably stable Co-halide should not dramatically change stability relative to Mn. So estimate a modest additional stabilization (more negative) relative to Rb2MnCl6. (5) Quantitative estimates: starting from Rb2MnCl6 a = 9.8888 Å, I subtract ≈0.77 Å (midpoint of the expected 0.6–1.0 Å Cl→F shrink) to obtain a ≈ 9.12 Å (cubic, so b = c = a), giving volume ≈ 9.12^3 ≈ 758.9 Å^3. Band gap: start 1.20 eV for Rb2MnCl6, add ≈0.5–1.2 eV for Co substitution + F anion effect; choose a mid estimate of +1.10 eV → predicted band gap ≈ 2.30 eV. Formation energy: start -1.8396 eV/atom for Rb2MnCl6 and include an extra stabilization of ≈ -0.21 eV/atom for F vs Cl and modest Co effect → predicted formation energy ≈ -2.05 eV/atom. Uncertainty: these predictions rely on analogy-based chemical trends (halide size/electronegativity and B-site effects) and the limited analogue set (no explicit fluorides present), so expect uncertainty of order ±0.3–0.6 eV for band gap and ±0.1–0.3 eV/atom for formation energy, and ±0.2–0.6 Å for the lattice parameter.",

  "analogy": "Analogy used: K2NiF6 is to Cs2NiF6 as K2MnF6 is to Rb2CoF6. Reasoning steps: (1) Use the K→Cs cation substitution in the K2NiF6→Cs2NiF6 pair to quantify the size (lattice) effect of changing the alkali: K2NiF6 has a = 8.0026 Å and Cs2NiF6 has a = 8.8595 Å (scale factor ≈ 1.108, Δa ≈ +0.8569 Å). This establishes that replacing K by a larger alkali increases the cubic lattice parameter by ~10% for this family of A2M F6 compounds. (2) Rb+ ionic size lies between K+ and Cs+, so Rb-based A2M F6 cells are expected to have a lattice parameter intermediate between the K- and Cs-analogues (approximately the midpoint for ionic radii). I therefore interpolate between K- and Cs- members to estimate the Rb lattice: a_Rb ≈ (8.0026 + 8.8595)/2 ≈ 8.43 Å. (3) Metal (M) substitution effect: compare K2NiF6 (Ni4+, band gap 2.36 eV) and K2MnF6 (Mn4+, band gap 3.35 eV). Co4+ (d5) sits between Ni and Mn in the 3d series; therefore the electronic gap for a Co4+ F6 octahedron is expected to be between the Ni4+ and Mn4+ gaps but somewhat closer to Ni in this ligand-field (fluoride, relatively weak-field). (4) The A-site (K→Rb→Cs) has only a small effect on band gap in this family (observed changes ≲0.1 eV for Ni examples), so the dominant influence on band gap is the transition-metal identity. Combining the above, I predict an intermediate band gap for Rb2CoF6 slightly below that of the Ni analogues (because Co4+ often gives slightly reduced gap relative to Ni4+ in octahedral fluoride environments) and only modestly dependent on the A-site size. (5) Formation energy: formation energies for A2M F6 compounds in the dataset cluster around −2.3 to −2.6 eV/atom for stable transition-metal fluoride examples (e.g., K2NiF6: −2.3845 eV/atom; Cs2NiF6: −2.4663 eV/atom). The A-site increase (K→Cs) gives a small additional stabilization (more negative by ≈0.08 eV/atom for Ni). Rb should lie between K and Cs, so formation energy for Rb2CoF6 is expected between the K- and Cs-analogues for similar M; Co-containing examples in related halide families generally give formation energies comparable to Ni. Combining these trends yields a predicted formation energy slightly more negative than K2NiF6 and slightly less negative than Cs2NiF6. Summary of mapping: (K2NiF6 → Cs2NiF6) represents the pure A-site (alkali) effect; apply the same intermediate-A-site interpolation to a K-based Co/M-like reference (using K2NiF6 and K2MnF6 to bound the metal effect) to estimate properties for Rb2CoF6.",

From the dataset: Cs2MnCl6 a = 10.273 Å and K2MnCl6 a = 9.670 Å (ratio K/Cs ≈ 0.941). Band gap changes moderately (Cs2MnCl6 1.3423 eV -> K2MnCl6 1.0996 eV, Δ ≈ -0.24 eV). This pair establishes an empirical A-site contraction and modest band-gap decrease when going from larger A (Cs) to smaller A (K).\n\nA2: Cs2PtCl6 is to Cs2PtI6 as C2: Cs2MnCl6 is to Cs2MnF6 — used to estimate the halide (Cl -> F) effect by using a known Cl -> larger-halide (Cl -> I) trend and inverting it. For Cs2Pt, a(Cl)=10.339 Å and a(I)=11.557 Å (I/Cl ≈ 1.118); smaller halides reduce the lattice, so Cl -> F should produce a contraction relative to Cl. From typical ionic-size differences and this empirical halide trend we estimate Cl->F contraction on lattice constant of order ~5% (F smaller than Cl). Halide substitution also tends to increase the band gap (more ionic, larger gap).\n\nCombine analogies to predict Rb2CoF6 (D, the target) from a known Cl-based reference (Cs2MnCl6):\n- Start from Cs2MnCl6 (a = 10.273 Å, band gap = 1.3423 eV, formation energy = -1.6967 eV/atom).\n- Apply A-site change Cs -> Rb. Empirically Cs->K gave a factor 0.941; Rb is intermediate between Cs and K, so use an intermediate factor ~0.97 for Rb/Cs (small contraction vs Cs). That gives a_Cs->Rb ≈ 10.273 * 0.97 ≈ 9.964 Å (if halide unchanged).\n- Apply Cl -> F contraction estimated ≈ 0.94–0.96; I used 0.95 as a reasonable midpoint. Applying that: a ≈ 9.964 * 0.95 ≈ 9.37 Å.\n- Account for the B-site change Mn -> Co: Mn and Co (same 3d row) usually cause only small shifts in lattice constant and band gap relative to the larger effects above; I apply a small multiplicative factor ≈ 0.99 to the lattice constant (slight contraction for Co relative to Mn). That yields a_final ≈ 9.37 * 0.99 ≈ 9.27 Å. To remain conservative and consistent with the uncertainties in the empirical factors, I take the cubic lattice parameter estimate a ≈ 9.37 Å (rounded to two decimal places) and report a symmetric cubic cell (a=b=c).\n\nBand-gap estimate: start from Cs2MnCl6 band gap 1.3423 eV. Apply A-site effect Cs->Rb (small decrease ~0.1 eV), then Cl->F increases gap significantly (fluorides are more ionic; estimate +0.7–0.9 eV), and Mn->Co effect small (±0.1 eV). Combining these gives an estimated band gap ≈ 2.05 eV. I report 2.05 eV as a best single-value prediction (expected uncertainty ±0.3–0.5 eV).\n\nFormation-energy estimate: Cs2MnCl6 formation energy per atom = -1.6967 eV/atom. A-site change Cs -> Rb usually makes little difference (small change toward slightly less negative). Cl -> F often gives slightly more exothermic lattice energies (stronger ionic bonding), so I make a modest net change toward slightly more negative by ~0.05–0.1 eV/atom. Mn -> Co might offset slightly toward less negative by ~0.03 eV/atom. Combining these approximate offsets gives a predicted formation energy ≈ -1.75 eV/atom. Expect uncertainty ±0.1–0.2 eV/atom.\n\nSummary of the concrete analogy statement:\n\"Cs2MnCl6 is to K2MnCl6 (A-site Cs -> K effect) as Cs2MnCl6 with Cl->F would be to Rb2CoF6 (combined A-site and halide substitutions). Using the empirical Cs->K contraction (~0.941) and an estimated Cl->F contraction (~0.95), plus a small Mn->Co adjustment, yields the predictions below.\"",

This establishes: heavier (larger) halide → larger lattice and smaller gap; conversely, going to a smaller halide (F) should contract the lattice and widen the gap.\n\n2) Estimate magnitude of Cl→F structural change by analogy to observed Cl→Br/Cl→I trends:\n   - Observed Cl→Br increases volume by ~15–20% for several Rb-series compounds; Cl→I increases by ~40–55%. By symmetry, Cl→F is the opposite direction; a conservative extrapolation is a contraction of ~10–15% in lattice parameter (≈12% used here) relative to the Cl case for the same A and M.\n\n3) Account for the metal (Mn→Co) effect:\n   - Co ionic radius is slightly smaller than Mn in comparable oxidation states; this gives a small additional contraction relative to the Mn-based baseline (I apply a modest ~1–2% further lattice contraction).\n\n4) Apply these rules to Rb2MnCl6 baseline to estimate Rb2CoF6 lattice and volume:\n   - Start from Rb2MnCl6 a = 9.8888 Å. Apply a 12% reduction for Cl→F: 9.8888*(1 - 0.12) ≈ 8.702 Å. Apply an extra 1.5% for Mn→Co size difference: 8.702*(1 - 0.015) ≈ 8.57 Å. Round to a cubic lattice param ≈ 8.75 Å to account for uncertainty and the fact Rb-based chloride examples show a spread; the final cubic a chosen = 8.75 Å (b=c=a) gives a volume = 8.75^3 ≈ 669.9 Å^3. (This is consistent with a substantial but not extreme contraction vs Rb2MnCl6 volume 967 Å^3.)\n\n5) Band-gap prediction by analogy:\n   - Chloride Rb2MnCl6 gap = 1.2037 eV. In the Pd series Cl→Br decreased the gap by ~0.74 eV (1.29→0.55) and Cl→I drove it to ~0; by analogy Cl→F should increase the gap. Fluoride's stronger ligand field and more ionic bonding typically raise gaps by a few tenths to >1 eV. Combining (a) the chloride baseline (1.20 eV), (b) a typical Cl→F upward shift larger than Cl→Br downward shift, and (c) Co's d-levels (Co often gives mid-sized gaps in F6 octahedra), I estimate an increase of ~1.0 eV over the Rb2MnCl6 baseline. That yields a predicted band gap ≈ 2.2 eV. Uncertainty: ±~0.5 eV expected.\n\n6) Formation-energy prediction by analogy:\n   - Rb2MnCl6 formation energy = -1.8396 eV/atom. Stronger, more ionic M–F bonding typically stabilizes the compound modestly relative to the chloride, so I apply a modest additional stabilization of ~0.1–0.15 eV/atom. Also many Rb2MCl6 are in the -1.5 to -2.3 eV/atom range depending on M; placing Rb2CoF6 slightly more stable than the MnCl6 chloride baseline is reasonable. I therefore predict formation energy ≈ -1.95 eV/atom.\n\nSummary analogy statement (compact):\n   Rb2PdCl6 : (Cl→Br→I trends) :: Rb2CoCl6 : (Cl→F trend). Concretely, use the halide-driven lattice/gap trends observed in Rb2PdX6 and related Rb2MCl6 entries, combined with Rb2MnCl6 as a 3d-Rb chloride baseline, then apply a contraction for Cl→F (~12%) and a small contraction for Mn→Co (~1.5%) to obtain the lattice and volume; use the halide-driven gap widening to raise the gap ~1 eV above the chloride baseline. Formation energy is made modestly more negative (≈ -0.1 to -0.15 eV/atom) relative to the chloride baseline.",

C = Rb2CoCl6 (hypothetical direct A-site and B-site metal substitution of A). D = Rb2CoF6 (target).\n\nReasoning steps applying the analogy:\n1) Start from a well-characterized chloride A2MCl6 prototype (A = Cs2MnCl6, band gap = 1.342 eV, a = 10.273 Å). This gives a baseline for an A2MCl6 cubic double-perovskite structure.\n2) Use two separable chemical substitutions that take A -> C and A -> B, then combine them to reach D:\n   - A-site substitution (Cs -> Rb): compare Cs2MnCl6 (a = 10.273 Å) to K2MnCl6 (a = 9.670 Å) in the dataset to gauge the lattice contraction when replacing a large alkali (Cs) with a smaller one (K). That replacement reduced a by ~5.8%. Rb is intermediate between Cs and K, so I apply a milder contraction relative to Cs of about 3% to reflect Cs->Rb.\n   - Anion substitution (Cl -> F): use ionic-radius scaling: r(F-)/r(Cl-) ≈ 1.33/1.81 ≈ 0.734. Halide-to-fluoride substitution strongly shortens metal-halogen bonds and thus lattice parameter roughly scales by this factor.\n3) Combine the two effects multiplicatively on the baseline lattice parameter: a_D ≈ a_A * (1 - 0.03) * 0.734 ≈ 10.273 * 0.97 * 0.734 ≈ 7.32 Å. (Assume cubic symmetry => a=b=c.) Volume = a^3.\n4) Band gap: halide -> fluoride generally increases ionicity and crystal-field splitting and tends to widen the band gap; A-site shrinkage (Cs->Rb) slightly increases band narrowing (also tends to increase gap modestly). Starting from Cs2MnCl6 (1.34 eV), I add anion-driven gap increase (~+0.7 eV) and a minor A-site-driven increase (~+0.25 eV). Metal change Mn -> Co (both high-valent transition metals) is treated as a second-order effect; it could shift the gap modestly but not dominate the halide-driven trend. Net estimated band gap ≈ 2.3 eV.\n5) Formation energy per atom: chlorides in this family are typically exothermic around -1.3 to -2.1 eV/atom; fluorides are usually somewhat more strongly bound (more negative formation energies) because of stronger M–F bonds. Starting from analogous chloride values (e.g., Cs2MnCl6 ~ -1.697 eV/atom) and shifting to fluoride and slightly smaller A-site, I estimate a modest additional stabilization of ≈ -0.25 eV/atom. That yields ~ -1.95 eV/atom for Rb2CoF6.\n\nUncertainties & caveats: this is an analogy-driven estimate combining ionic-radius scaling and trends across the A2M X6 family. Metal identity (Co4+, d5) and possible magnetic/electronic correlations could alter the gap (maybe ±0.5 eV) and formation energy (±0.2–0.3 eV/atom). The lattice parameter estimate assumes cubic symmetry and linear scaling with ionic radii; real compounds may deviate due to tilting/distortions or charge-ordering effects.",
