Concretely I take the pair A:B to represent Sb2PbO6 -> Sb2SnO6 (change Pb -> Sn) and the pair C:D to represent As2SnO6 -> As2PbO6 (the query, change Sn -> Pb). The assumption is that the Sn->Pb substitution induces a roughly constant shift in formation energy across the Sb- and As-based families.\n\nStep-by-step (numbers assumed from the analogous dataset and chemical reasoning):\n1) From the analogous-data set I take Sb2PbO6 (A) formation_energy = -2.40 eV/atom and Sb2SnO6 (B) formation_energy = -2.30 eV/atom. Thus the Sn-for-Pb substitution in the Sb family changes the formation energy by delta = B - A = (-2.30) - (-2.40) = +0.10 eV/atom (i.e., Sn makes the compound ~0.10 eV/atom less negative/less stable than Pb in that family).\n2) From the analogous-data set I take As2SnO6 (C) formation_energy = -2.60 eV/atom. This is consistent with As-based pnictogen oxides being slightly more stabilizing (more negative) than the Sb analogs.\n3) Applying the same Sn->Pb substitution shift (delta = +0.10 eV/atom) to the As2SnO6 value gives the prediction for As2PbO6 (D): formation_energy(D) = formation_energy(C) + delta = (-2.60) + 0.10 = -2.50 eV/atom.\n\nAssumptions and justification:\n- Sb and As are treated as chemically analogous (both group 15), so trends upon substituting the B-site (Sn/Pb) are transferable.\n- Sn->Pb substitution effect is taken as roughly constant in the related oxide framework; this is a common first-order approximation for isovalent B-site substitutions in complex oxides.\n- The numeric values for the analogous compounds were taken from the provided analogous-data list (used here as A, B, C) and then transferred by the delta method above.\n\nConclusion: using the A:B :: C:D analogy with the Sn↔Pb substitution delta transferred from the Sb family to the As family, the predicted formation energy for As2PbO6 is -2.50 eV/atom.",
