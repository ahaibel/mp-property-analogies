  "analogy": "Analogy used and reasoning steps:\n\n1) Identify close structural/chemical analogues and two separable trends: (a) A-site cation change (Cs→Rb) produces only a small change in band gap for the A2MCl6 family; (b) halide substitution (Cl→Br→I) shows a large systematic effect — moving to heavier, less electronegative halides reduces the gap, so moving to a more electronegative halide (Cl→F) should increase the gap by a comparable magnitude.\n\n2) Use observed A-site trend to estimate the Rb2– vs Cs2– effect: Cs2MnCl6 = 1.3423 eV and Rb2MnCl6 = 1.2037 eV (Δ ≈ -0.1386 eV). This suggests Rb vs Cs shifts are small (~0.1–0.2 eV). Therefore, as a proxy for Rb2CoCl6 we take a Cl-based Rb2 MCl6 value near 1.2–1.3 eV.\n\n3) Use halide substitution magnitude from well-populated families to estimate Cl→F shift magnitude. Example: Cs2SnCl6 (2.59 eV) → Cs2SnBr6 (1.4389 eV) is a change of -1.1511 eV (Cl→Br). Similar Cl→Br reductions of ~1.1–1.3 eV are seen for other B-site chemistries (Rb2SnCl6→Rb2SnBr6, Cs2PtCl6→Cs2PtBr6, etc.). I assume the magnitude of halide-driven band-gap change is similar but with opposite sign when going from Cl→F (i.e., Cl→F should increase the gap by ~1.15 eV).\n\n4) Combine the two effects with a proxy for Rb2CoCl6: take Rb2MnCl6 (1.2037 eV) as the best available Cl-based proxy and allow a small upward adjustment for Co vs Mn; I set Rb2CoCl6 ≈ 1.25 eV (rounded, consistent with the family spread).\n\n5) Apply the estimated Cl→F increase (≈+1.15 eV) to get Rb2CoF6 ≈ 1.25 + 1.1511 ≈ 2.40 eV.\n\nAnalogical statement (A:B :: C:D):\nCs2SnCl6 is to Cs2SnBr6 (change ≈ -1.15 eV when Cl→Br) as Rb2CoCl6 is to Rb2CoF6 (I use the same magnitude of halide-driven change but reversed sign for Cl→F), giving Rb2CoF6 ≈ Rb2CoCl6 + 1.15 eV.

Empirically, changing the alkali cation (K vs Cs vs Rb) produces only a small shift (~0.04–0.08 eV) in the reported dataset, so Rb vs K should not strongly modify the gap.\n\nUsing this analogy I interpolate between the measured d6 (K2NiF6 = 2.3603 eV) and d3 (K2MnF6 = 3.3462 eV) values to estimate the d5 (Co4+) case.

Rb lies between K and Cs, so the K->Rb change should be roughly half that magnitude (≈ +0.12 eV when going from K to Rb). I use this to map gaps between K- and Rb-containing compounds.\n\n2) Halide effect (Cl -> F): in this family moving to a more electronegative/smaller anion increases the gap. From several halide series (e.g., Cs2TiCl6 2.2291 eV vs Cs2TiI6 0.8643 eV, and Cs2SnCl6 2.59 eV vs Cs2SnI6 0.2938 eV) the Cl->I changes are ~1.2–2.3 eV; this implies the Cl->F shift (making the anion more electronegative than Cl) will increase the gap by of order 1.0–1.3 eV for typical B-site cations. I adopt an intermediate Cl->F shift of +1.20 eV for transition-metal B4+ octahedral compounds.\n\n3) B-site (Mn -> Co) effect: comparing different 3d B-site cations in similar structural positions tends to produce modest shifts (~±0.1–0.4 eV). Co4+ (d5) is expected to give a slightly smaller gap than Mn4+ (d3) in otherwise similar coordination because of the different d-level occupancy and bandwidth. I apply a modest downward adjustment of -0.20 eV for Mn->Co.\n\nPutting these together as an analogy-based transform starting from the nearest available, K2MnCl6 (1.0996 eV):\n  - add Cl->F shift (+1.20 eV) to estimate K2MnF6\n  - adjust Mn->Co (-0.20 eV) to get K2CoF6\n  - adjust K->Rb (+0.12 eV) to get Rb2CoF6\n\nThus the chain of analogical changes (A-site, halide, B-site) yields the numeric prediction below.\n\nUncertainty note: this uses averaged trends from several different B-site chemistries and halide series in the dataset.
