  "analogy": "I used a chemical-substitution analogy: compare how replacing Sb by As affects known A(SbO3)2 -> A(AsO3)2 systems, then apply that average change to the known Sb2PbO6 entry to predict As2PbO6. Steps: (1) Collect pairs where the same cation/structure exists for both Sb and As (Sr, Hg, Ca, Cd, Mn). (2) Compute average changes when Sb -> As: band gap increase ≈ +0.452 eV; formation energy becomes less negative by ≈ +0.144 eV/atom; a (and b) decreases by ≈ -0.411 Å; c increases by ≈ +0.0779 Å; cell volume decreases by ≈ -16.29 Å^3. (3) Apply these average shifts to the Sb2PbO6 data (band_gap = 1.9265 eV, formation_energy = -1.90030558 eV/atom, a=b=5.319425593 Å, c=5.38058013 Å, volume=131.85275607 Å^3) to estimate As2PbO6.

  "analogy": "Sb2PbO6 is to As2PbO6 as a Sb->As substitution in A2B O6-type oxides: use the known Sb2PbO6 entry as the closest analogue and apply expected trends when replacing Sb (larger, less electronegative) with As (smaller, slightly more electronegative). Reasoning steps: (1) Structural trend — As is smaller than Sb, so lattice parameters should contract modestly. I assume a uniform linear contraction of ~1.7% (within typical 1–3% range for same-group substitution) relative to Sb2PbO6 (a=b=5.319425593245637, c=5.38058013). Calculation: a,b = 5.319425593245637*(1 - 0.017) = 5.23 (rounded); c = 5.38058013*(1 - 0.017) = 5.29 (rounded). Volume scales roughly with the cube of the linear scale factor: 131.85275606955437*(0.983)^3 = 125.22 A^3 (rounded). (2) Electronic trend — smaller cell and more electronegative As tend to shift bands modestly; prediction is a slight increase in band gap compared to Sb2PbO6 (1.9265 eV). I estimate an increase of ~0.17–0.20 eV to account for both the chemical and lattice effects, giving ~2.10 eV. (3) Thermodynamic trend — As–O bonds are typically comparable or slightly stronger than Sb–O, so formation energy per atom will be similar but marginally more negative (more stable). Starting from Sb2PbO6 formation energy -1.90030558 eV/atom, I estimate ~-1.95 eV/atom. These small shifts are consistent with the close chemical analogy and are conservative estimates based on atomic-size and electronegativity differences.",

  "analogy": "I construct the analogy: As2PdO6 is to Pd as As2PbO6 is to Pb. Reasoning steps: (1) Structural family: both formulas are As2M O6 (M = transition or post-transition metal) and the data set contains As2PdO6 and several M(AsO3)2 entries (M = Cd, Hg, Ca, Sr, etc.), so As2PdO6 is the closest direct analogue for predicting As2PbO6. (2) Electronic trend: As2PdO6 is metallic (band gap 0.0 eV). Among other heavy, post-transition cations in the set, Hg(AsO3)2 has a small gap (0.7083 eV) and Cd(AsO3)2 a larger gap (1.9349 eV). Pb is chemically closer to Cd/Hg (heavy post-transition, s/p character) than to Pd (late transition d-metal), so I expect a small but nonzero gap for As2PbO6, closer to Hg’s small-gap behavior than Pd’s metallic behavior. (3) Formation energy trend: As2PdO6 has formation energy per atom −1.370 eV; Hg(AsO3)2 and Cd(AsO3)2 are −1.465 and −1.697 eV/atom respectively. Pb compounds in oxide networks typically have slightly more negative formation energies than Pd-containing analogues but similar to Hg, so I interpolate toward the Hg/Cd values to pick a moderately negative formation energy. (4) Lattice parameters/volume: As2PdO6 has a=b≈4.8477 Å and c≈4.6760 Å with volume 95.16 Å3. Analogous As-containing compounds with heavier post-transition cations (Cd, Hg) show similar a but larger c (Cd: a≈4.853 Å, c≈4.895 Å, V≈99.8 Å3; Hg: a≈4.874 Å, c≈5.046 Å, V≈103.8 Å3). Pb is expected to give lattice parameters between Pd and Hg/Cd, with slightly expanded c relative to Pd. So I predict a=b≈4.86 Å, c≈4.95 Å giving a volume similar to the Hg/Cd analogues (~104 Å3). (5) Summary: using the closest direct analogue As2PdO6 and interpolating toward heavier post-transition analogues (Hg, Cd), I predict a small nonzero band gap, a moderately negative formation energy per atom (slightly more negative than As2PdO6), and lattice constants slightly larger than As2PdO6 and similar to Cd/Hg analogues.",

  "analogy": "Analogy (form: A is to B as C is to D):\nA = Li2SnF6 (small-fluoride double-perovskite) is to B = BaCa2I6 (large-iodide double-perovskite) as C = Li2SnF6 (fluoride baseline) is to D = As2PbO6 (query).  Reasoning steps and mapping used to make the prediction:\n1) I use Li2SnF6 as a baseline because it is an A2B X6-type compound in the dataset with small lattice (a≈4.91 Å, vol≈94.73 Å3) and a large band gap (5.009 eV). Comparing that fluoride baseline to a large-iodide example (BaCa2I6: a≈8.04 Å, vol≈427.51 Å3, band gap 3.862 eV) shows the typical effect of (i) increasing anion size and (ii) moving to much larger cations: the lattice parameters and cell volume increase strongly (factor ~4.5 in volume here) while the band gap decreases (here by ~1.15 eV). Formation energy per atom becomes less negative (less thermodynamic stability per atom) going from fluoride to iodide in these examples (Δ ≈ +1.11 eV/atom).\n2) To estimate As2PbO6 I apply the same directional trends but with two important adjustments: (a) O2− is chemically closer to F− than I− (so the volume increase vs Li2SnF6 should be moderate, not as large as the F→I jump), and (b) Pb (6s/6p states) strongly pushes valence-band edge up (Pb-containing oxides and halide perovskites are commonly much narrower-gap than analogous fluoride materials). Therefore I scale the volume up from the Li2SnF6 baseline but by a smaller factor than for the F→I change (I-case factor ≈4.5). A conservative intermediate scale factor ≈2.52 gives a predicted volume ≈94.73*2.52 ≈ 239 Å3 (rounded). For simplicity I report a quasi-cubic cell (a=b=c) that matches that volume: a=b=c≈6.20 Å (6.20^3 = 238.33 Å3) — this is consistent with an A2B O6-type double-perovskite cell larger than typical fluorides but much smaller than iodides.\n3) Band-gap estimate: starting from Li2SnF6 (5.01 eV) the F→I example reduced the gap by ≈1.15 eV. Replacing F by O normally gives a smaller reduction than F→I, but the presence of Pb (6s lone pair) is expected to reduce the gap substantially (analogous Pb-based perovskites often have gaps in the 1–2 eV range). Combining these effects I estimate a strong net reduction from the fluoride baseline. I therefore predict a band gap ≈1.8 eV for As2PbO6 (this reflects both the anion/cell-size change and the Pb-driven band-edge chemistry).\n4) Formation-energy estimate: fluorides in the dataset have formation energies per atom in the −3.0 to −3.7 eV range. Iodides are less negative (≈−1.9 to −2.0 eV/atom). Oxides are typically at least as stable as fluorides on a per-atom basis; given the dataset trends and the involvement of Pb and As (which are chemically well-bonding to O), I predict a formation energy somewhat more negative than the fluoride baseline or similar: I choose −3.30 eV/atom as a conservative estimate (moderately stable, somewhat more negative than Li2SnF6's −3.028 eV/atom because oxide bonding is stronger than fluoride bonding for heavy cations here).\nUncertainties and caveats: these estimates are interpolation/extrapolation based on trends in the provided A2B X6 dataset (F→I scaling, cation-size effects) plus known qualitative Pb chemistry. Actual crystal symmetry, site occupancies, oxidation states (As could be +3 or +5, Pb could be +2 or +4) and electronic structure details will change the numbers; expect ±0.5–1.0 eV uncertainty on the band gap and ±0.3–0.6 eV/atom on the formation energy, and ±5–15% on lattice/volume.\n",

  "analogy": "Analogy used: I treat the Sb->As substitution and the choice of the divalent cation (alkaline-earth vs heavy post-transition metal) as separable, approximately additive effects. Concretely: Sr(SbO3)2 is to Hg(SbO3)2 as Sr(AsO3)2 is to Pb(AsO3)2 (i.e. As2PbO6). Rationale and steps: (1) Choose a pair in the dataset that isolates the effect of changing the cation from a typical alkaline-earth (Sr) to a heavy post-transition metal (Hg): Sr(SbO3)2 (band gap 2.7881 eV, formation energy -2.3863 eV/atom, a=b=5.2917 Å, c=5.3866 Å, V=130.63 Å3) -> Hg(SbO3)2 (band gap 0.5173 eV, formation energy -1.6204 eV/atom, a=b=5.2978 Å, c=4.92415 Å, V=119.69 Å3). That change (Sr->Hg) produces a large band-gap reduction (~2.27 eV), a destabilization (formation energy increase) of ~+0.77 eV/atom, and a modest reduction of c and of unit-cell volume (~ -10.94 Å3). (2) Apply the same qualitative cation effect to the As-bearing compounds: replacing Sb by As generally makes the anion network slightly smaller/more covalent and tends to increase the band gap modestly and make formation energies slightly more negative (As is smaller/more electronegative than Sb). I estimate an Sb->As shift of roughly +0.1 to +0.3 eV in band gap and -0.05 to -0.15 eV/atom in formation energy (based on typical periodic trends and the dataset variety of group-15 substitutions). (3) Combine the two effects to go from a baseline Sr(AsO3)2 (start with Sr(SbO3)2 values and add a small Sb->As band-gap increase and small volume contraction) and then apply the Sr->Pb cation effect. Pb2+ is a heavy post-transition cation with a stereoactive lone pair; experimentally and from trends in the dataset Pb-based compounds typically have electronic behavior between Cd/Hg and alkaline-earths (i.e., smaller gaps than alkaline-earth analogues but not necessarily as metallic as Hg). Therefore I take the Sr->Hg band-gap reduction as an upper bound and scale it down (roughly half to two-thirds) for Sr->Pb. Numerically: start from Sr(SbO3)2 gap 2.788 eV; Sb->As +0.15 eV -> Sr(AsO3)2 ≈ 2.94 eV. Apply Sr->Pb gap reduction ~ -1.7 eV (interpolating between Sr->Cd and Sr->Hg effects) -> As2PbO6 gap ≈ 1.24 eV. For formation energy: start from Sr(SbO3)2 formation -2.386 eV/atom; Sb->As change ~ -0.10 eV/atom -> Sr(AsO3)2 ≈ -2.486 eV/atom. Sr->Hg change was +0.766 eV/atom, but Sr->Pb should be smaller (Pb less destabilizing than Hg) — I apply +0.64 eV/atom -> As2PbO6 formation ≈ -1.85 eV/atom. For lattice/volume: Sr(SbO3)2 has a=b=5.2917 Å, c=5.3866 Å, V=130.63 Å3; Hg(SbO3)2 has similar a,b but reduced c and V (119.69 Å3). Sb->As should shrink the cell a little (~2–3% in volume). Pb substitution (from Sr) reduces c and volume but not as strongly as Hg. Combining these trends I estimate a small contraction relative to the Sb-based Sr/Hg range: choose a=b = 5.24 Å, c = 4.78 Å. Using the same hexagonal/trigonal cell metric (V = (sqrt(3)/2) * a^2 * c) gives V ≈ 113.8 Å3. Uncertainties: these are empirical, trend-based estimates; expected uncertainty ±~0.3–0.6 eV on band gap and ±~0.1–0.3 eV/atom on formation energy; lattice constants ±~0.03–0.1 Å and volume ±~2–6 Å3.",

  "analogy": "Analogy used: I treat the known fluoride (Li2SnF6) and iodide (BaCa2I6) examples as end-members that bracket structural size, band-gap and formation-energy behavior when the anion is changed (F -> O -> I). Concretely: Li2SnF6 (small cell, large gap, strongly negative formation energy) is to BaCa2I6 (large cell, smaller gap, less negative formation energy) as As2PbO6 (oxide, intermediate anion size/electronegativity) should be to the predicted properties. Reasoning steps: (1) Use Li2SnF6 and BaCa2I6 as representative fluoride/iodide endpoints. (2) For band gap take a geometric-average (intermediate electronic confinement) of the fluoride and iodide band gaps: sqrt(5.0089 * 3.8624) ≈ 4.40 eV, applied as the oxide sits between F and I in electronic polarizability. (3) For formation energy take an arithmetic midpoint between the strongly negative fluoride value (-3.0284 eV/atom for Li2SnF6) and the less-negative iodide value (-1.9173 eV/atom for BaCa2I6): (-3.0284 + -1.9173)/2 = -2.47285 eV/atom, because oxides are typically more strongly bound than iodides but somewhat less negative than the most-stable fluorides in the provided set.

  "analogy": "I use a structural/chemical analogy between the A2B X6 double-octahedral family entries in the table and the query As2PbO6. Reasoning steps: 1) Choose Li2SnF6 (a = 4.9095 Å, gap = 5.0089 eV, vol = 94.727 Å^3) as a compact, fully-oxidic/ionic reference with an octahedral X-site network (A2B X6). 2) Consider how two systematic substitutions change properties: (i) anion change F -> O: O2- is similar in size to F- but is more polarizable and yields more covalent B–O bonding; this tends to slightly increase lattice parameters or leave them similar and to reduce band gaps relative to the corresponding fluoride by increasing valence-band dispersion and covalency. (ii) B-site change Sn(IV) -> Pb(II/IV character): introducing Pb (heavy p element with 6s/6p states and lone-pair influence) typically brings conduction-band states down in energy (smaller gap) and increases formation energy magnitude (stronger bonding to O) versus many halide B-sites. 3) Empirical trends in the provided dataset: fluoride A2B X6 examples have large gaps (Li2ZrF6 6.48 eV, Li2SnF6 5.01 eV) while chlorides/iodides and transition-metal containing compositions trend to smaller gaps (<4 eV). Formation energies per atom in the table range from ~-1.9 eV/atom (large-iodide materials) to ~-3.7 eV/atom (fluorides). Oxides are expected to be at least as stable as fluorides on a per-atom basis or slightly more negative due to stronger B–O bonding. 4) Combine the two substitution effects starting from Li2SnF6: (a) F -> O: decrease gap by ~0.5–1.5 eV (more covalent O lowers gap relative to F); (b) Sn -> Pb: further decrease gap by ~0.5–1.5 eV due to Pb 6p states. Summing those effects gives an expected reduction of roughly 2–2.7 eV from the Li2SnF6 gap (5.01 eV) → predicted gap ≈ 2.3 eV. 5) For formation energy, start from typical fluoride formation energies (~-3.0 to -3.7 eV/atom) and shift slightly more negative for oxide chemistry and heavy Pb–O/As–O bonding; predict around -3.1 eV/atom. 6) For lattice parameters, start from the compact fluoride cell (a ≈ 4.91 Å) and apply modest expansion to account for larger/more polarizable anion environment and heavier B-site (Sn->Pb) and A-site change (Li→As in the A2B X6 motif is chemically different, but geometrically we expect a modest linear expansion of a few percent). A linear scale-up of about 4% yields a ≈ b ≈ c ≈ 5.10 Å and a cubic-cell volume ≈ 132.65 Å^3. These steps constitute the analogy: Li2SnF6 (compact fluoride double-octahedral) is to its measured electronic/structural properties as As2PbO6 (oxide, heavier B-site) is to the predicted properties after applying the F->O and Sn->Pb substitution trends.",

  "analogy": "Analogy used: Li2NbF6 is to Li2NbF6 (known analogue) as As2PbO6 (query) is to As2PbO6 (prediction). More explicitly: I treat Li2NbF6 (analogue) as the chemical/structural proxy because (1) Li2NbF6 contains a pentavalent transition metal (Nb5+) in an octahedral environment similar to the pentavalent cation role of As5+ in As2PbO6, and (2) both formulas follow the A2B X6 / A2B O6 stoichiometry (9 atoms per formula unit), so they are good starting points for geometric scaling. Mapping chosen: Nb5+ (analogue) -> As5+ (query); Li+ (analogue) -> Pb2+ (query) (treated here as the larger, charge-different A-site cation that will expand the lattice); F- (analogue) -> O2- (query) (anion size slightly larger for O2-). Reasoning and steps:\n\n1) Choice justification: Nb5+ and As5+ both supply high oxidation states that form octahedral BX6 units; Li2NbF6 data capture the structural motif and cell size of a small-cation octahedral network. Among the listed analogues, Li2NbF6 provides a direct Nb5+ comparator (Nb5+ ~ As5+ in nominal charge and coordination), so I use it as the primary analogue to scale from.\n\n2) Ionic-radius-based lattice scaling: I estimate an effective cation-radius scale factor from common Shannon-like ionic radii (approximate values used: Li+ (VI) ~0.76 Å, Nb5+ (VI) ~0.64 Å, As5+ (VI, estimated) ~0.46 Å, Pb2+ (VI) ~1.19 Å). For Li2NbF6 the average cation radius = (2*0.76 + 0.64)/3 = 0.72 Å. For As2PbO6 the average cation radius = (2*0.46 + 1.19)/3 = 0.703 Å. The ratio cation_scale = 0.703/0.72 = 0.976.\n\n3) Anion-size correction: F- -> O2- increases anion size slightly. Using approximate radii F- ~1.33 Å and O2- ~1.40 Å gives anion_factor = 1.40/1.33 = 1.053.\n\n4) Combined linear lattice scale factor = cation_scale * anion_factor = 0.976 * 1.053 = 1.028 (≈ +2.8% linear expansion compared to Li2NbF6).\n\n5) Apply to lattice of Li2NbF6 (a = 5.029 Å, c = 4.7096 Å, volume = 103.169 Å^3): a_pred = 5.029 * 1.028 = 5.17 Å; b_pred = same (tetragonal symmetry assumed) = 5.17 Å; c_pred = 4.7096 * 1.028 = 4.84 Å. Volume scales roughly as scale^3: volume_pred = 103.169 * 1.028^3 ≈ 112.2 Å^3.\n\n6) Band gap prediction reasoning: Li2NbF6 has a DFT band gap listed as 0.0 eV (Nb d-states produce small/zero gap in that analogue). Replacing Nb5+ by As5+ (p-block, typically more insulating in oxides) and replacing F- by O2- (stronger bonding, larger splitting) should open the gap substantially. Pb2+ can introduce 6s/6p states that reduce the gap compared with purely main-group pentavalent oxide, but not enough to make it metallic in an oxide arsenate network. Comparing trends across the dataset (e.g., Li2ZrF6 and Li2SnF6 exhibit large gaps ~5–6 eV for non-d-electron cations in fluorides), and applying a moderating effect for oxide vs fluoride and Pb contribution, I estimate a moderate-to-large insulating gap. Therefore I predict a band gap of about 3.2 eV for As2PbO6 (DFT-level expectation, likely an underestimate/subject to functional choice).\n\n7) Formation energy per atom reasoning: Fluoride analogues in the list have formation energies from about -3.7 to -3.0 eV/atom for the most stable cases (e.g., Li2ZrF6 -3.689 eV/atom), while iodide analogues are less negative (~-1.9 eV/atom). Oxides are typically more strongly bound than halides; shifting from a fluoride analogue like Li2NbF6 (-3.149 eV/atom) to an oxide with strong As–O and Pb–O bonding suggests a more negative formation energy. I apply a modest additional stabilization of ~0.3 eV/atom relative to Li2NbF6 to account for oxide bonding and the heavier Pb–O ties, yielding an estimated formation energy of -3.45 eV/atom.\n\nSummary of mapping: Li2NbF6 (analogue) -> scale geometry by +2.8% to account for As/Pb/O vs Li/Nb/F; increase band gap from 0.0 eV (Nb d-metal behaviour in fluoride) to a finite oxide gap dominated by As–O bonding; make formation energy more negative than the fluoride analogue because O yields stronger bonding.",
