      "score": 2,
      "justification": "The A\u2192B :: C\u2192D form enables a mapping, but fidelity depends entirely on the concrete choices. Without specifying which properties change and why, the mapping is only weakly reliable."

      "justification": "No materials, bonding types, or classes are specified, so there is no basis to claim the systems sit in the same family or design space."

    "Competing mechanisms": {
      "score": 1,
      "justification": "Because no property or systems are specified, multiple confounding mechanisms are likely and may dominate, so the analogy is unlikely to be governed by a single clear mechanism."
