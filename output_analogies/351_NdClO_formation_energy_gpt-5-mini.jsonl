These two share the same cation (Nd) and a highly electronegative halogen (F) while varying the chalcogen (S→Se). Their formation energies are similar and cluster near -3.29 eV/atom, showing that Nd + (chalcogen + F) motifs give very negative formation energies. I treat Eu/Ca/Ba Cl–F halide examples (EuClF -3.4616, CaClF -3.4642, SrClF -3.5413, BaClF -3.6019) as evidence that mixed halide/oxide motifs with highly ionic bonding also produce strongly negative energies around -3.3 to -3.6 eV/atom. Mapping: A (NdSF) is to B (NdSeF) as C (representative Cl–F/lanthanide halide like EuClF/CaClF) is to D (NdClO). That is, the strong negative formation energies seen for Nd-chalcogen-fluorides and for metal chlorofluorides suggest NdClO will also be strongly negative. I therefore predict NdClO's formation energy by averaging the closely related NdSF and NdSeF values (the best direct Nd-containing analogues) and taking that as the estimate for NdClO, with a small tolerance for the anion substitution (O vs F/Se) which likely produces only modest shifts. Steps: (1) select nearest analogues sharing Nd (NdSF, NdSeF); (2) note their energies cluster around -3.29 eV/atom; (3) use that cluster as the predicted formation energy for NdClO because Nd+highly‑electronegative anion combinations yield similar energetics.",

Observed for lanthanides (Ce, Gd) that replacing Br by F (CeBrO -> CeOF, GdBrO -> GdOF) stabilizes the compound by about 0.76–0.79 eV per atom. Chlorine should lie between Br and F in stabilizing effect, so I assume ClO is roughly halfway between BrO and OF (i.e. Br->Cl stabilization ~0.38–0.39 eV). To estimate NdBrO (which is not in the dataset) I interpolated between neighboring lanthanide BrO values (PrBrO = -3.25538 eV/atom and SmBrO = -3.31095 eV/atom) and took the midpoint ≈ -3.28316 eV/atom as an estimate for NdBrO.
