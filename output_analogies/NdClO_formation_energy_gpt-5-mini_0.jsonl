Reasoning: across the lanthanide oxychlorides (LnClO) the formation energy becomes modestly more negative with increasing atomic number.

Empirically, formation energies of LnOCl compounds change gradually and monotonically with atomic number due to small changes in ionic radius and bonding: each step from one lanthanide to the next typically shifts the per-atom formation energy by a few hundredths of an eV. Assuming a smoothly varying sequence (for example: LaOCl ≈ -2.30 eV/atom, CeOCl ≈ -2.40, PrOCl ≈ -2.50, SmOCl ≈ -2.70 in the same dataset), I perform a simple one-step interpolation from PrOCl to NdOCl, taking a typical step of ≈ -0.05 eV/atom per lanthanide step. Thus NdClO is predicted to be about -0.05 eV/atom more negative than PrOCl, yielding the value below. This is an approximate DFT-style trend-based estimate; uncertainty is on the order of a few hundredths to a few tenths of an eV per atom depending on functional and reference states.",
