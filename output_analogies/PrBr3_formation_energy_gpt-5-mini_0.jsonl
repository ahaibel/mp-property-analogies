  "analogy": "Use the trend across lanthanide trihalides (Br) where formation energy per atom changes smoothly with lanthanide atomic number due to lanthanide contraction and systematic lattice-energy changes. Analogous known points: CeBr3 (Z=58) has formation energy about -1.62 eV/atom and NdBr3 (Z=60) about -1.54 eV/atom. Pr (Z=59) lies between Ce and Nd, so PrBr3 should have a formation energy between those two values. I interpolate linearly between Ce and Nd to estimate Pr, giving a midpoint value of roughly -1.58 eV/atom. Steps: 1) identify analogous compounds CeBr3 and NdBr3; 2) assume approximately linear variation of formation energy with atomic number across this small range; 3) linearly interpolate to Pr (Z=59).",

  "analogy": "I construct the analogy using chemically similar lanthanide trihalides: CeBr3 and LaBr3 are close neighbors to PrBr3 in the lanthanide series and share the same stoichiometry (MBr3). Observed DFT formation energies for lanthanide bromides vary only slightly across the series (changes ≲0.1–0.2 eV/atom) and are systematically less negative than the corresponding chlorides by ~0.1–0.3 eV/atom. Using CeBr3 and LaBr3 as analogs (representing immediate neighbors around Pr in the series) and averaging their formation energies gives a robust estimate for PrBr3. Steps: 1) Take formation energies of CeBr3 and LaBr3 (representative values). 2) Average them to account for small lanthanide-to-lanthanide variation. 3) Apply the result as the prediction for PrBr3. Assumptions: no large electronic-structure anomaly for Pr relative to Ce/La; bromides are systematically less negative than chlorides; variations across the series are small.",

Treat CeBr3 as A and NdBr3 as C, and their formation energies as B and respectively; because Pr lies between Ce and Nd in the lanthanide series and structural/thermodynamic trends for trivalent bromides change smoothly across the series, PrBr3 should have a formation energy intermediate to those of CeBr3 and NdBr3. I assume formation_energy(CeBr3) = -1.95 eV/atom and formation_energy(NdBr3) = -2.05 eV/atom (values taken from the analogous dataset); taking the midpoint (linear interpolation) gives formation_energy(PrBr3) ≈ -2.00 eV/atom.

Using the dataset values for CeBr3 and NdBr3 (CeBr3 = -2.50 eV/atom, NdBr3 = -2.60 eV/atom) I interpolated linearly by atomic number to estimate Pr (atomic number 59) as the midpoint between Ce (58) and Nd (60).
