Both show a roughly constant multiplicative reduction (Br/Cl ratio ≈ 0.8045). Treat Pr as chemically similar to La/Ac in this series, so apply the same Br/Cl scaling to PrCl3. Calculation: PrCl3 band gap 4.3454 eV × mean Br/Cl ratio ≈ 0.8045 ⇒ predicted PrBr3 ≈ 3.50 eV.

To estimate the typical Cl->Br change, also include AcCl3->AcBr3 (5.0865 -> 4.1033). Compute the average Cl->Br shift from La and Ac, then apply that shift to PrCl3 to predict PrBr3. Steps: (1) Δ_La = 2.9266 - 3.6454 = -0.7188 eV. (2) Δ_Ac = 4.1033 - 5.0865 = -0.9832 eV. (3) average Δ = (-0.7188 + -0.9832)/2 = -0.8510 eV. (4) predicted PrBr3 = 4.3454 + (-0.8510) = 3.4944 eV.

Reasoning steps: 1) Compute the change in band gap on substituting Cl -> Br for La and Ac (both present in the dataset) to capture the typical halogen-induced shift for trivalent cations. 2) Average those shifts to reduce noise and avoid relying on Ce (which is an outlier due to 4f occupancy and shows nearly zero gap). 3) Apply the average shift to the known PrCl3 band gap to predict PrBr3.
