Use Rb2MnCl6 (-1.8396 eV/atom) as a proxy baseline for Rb2CoCl6 because Mn is the closest available B-site analogue.\n3) Use the chemical analogy of halide substitution: replacing Cl by the more electronegative F typically strengthens ionic/covalent bonding and makes formation energies more negative. From observed Cl->Br->I trends in the dataset (Cl generally more negative than Br and much more negative than I) and chemical reasoning, estimate the Cl->F shift to be on the order of -0.2 to -0.3 eV/atom (i.e., F-stabilized relative to Cl).\n4) Construct the analogy explicitly: Rb2MnCl6 is to Rb2MnF6 as Rb2CoCl6 is to Rb2CoF6 — i.e., the stabilizing effect of replacing Cl with F for a given A2BCl6 should be similar across neighboring transition-metal B-sites.

Based on typical halide trends in the dataset (Cl->I changes of ~+0.2–0.6 eV/atom depending on cation) and using a conservative Cl->F stabilization of -0.25 eV/atom, I apply that correction.
