That gives a first approximation for the Rb2M F6 lattice parameter by scaling the known chloride lattice parameter by 1.33/1.81 ≈ 0.734. Next, adjust slightly for the change of transition metal from Mn → Co (expected to cause only a small further contraction of the B-site octahedron in this family).

I use this as a reference cubic A2MCl6 chloride double-perovskite.  \nB = Cs2MnF6 (hypothetical) — obtained from A by changing the anion Cl -> F.  The dominant geometric effect of Cl->F is the change in anion ionic radius; to first order the cubic lattice changes roughly by 2*(r_X_new - r_X_old) because the lattice parameter in these A2M X6 structures scales approximately with the sum of the A and X ionic radii.  Using Shannon-like ionic radii (approx.): r_F = 1.33 Å, r_Cl = 1.81 Å, so Cl->F gives Δa ≈ 2*(1.33-1.81) = -0.96 Å.  Thus a(Cs2MnF6) ≈ 10.2733 - 0.96 = 9.3133 Å.\n\nC = Rb2CoCl6 (hypothetical) — obtained from A by changing the A-site cation Cs -> Rb.  Using approximate cation radii r_Rb = 1.66 Å, r_Cs = 1.88 Å, the change is Δa ≈ 2*(r_Rb - r_Cs) = 2*(1.66-1.88) = -0.44 Å, so a(Rb2CoCl6) ≈ 10.2733 - 0.44 = 9.8333 Å (this ignores a small M-site (Mn->Co) effect).\n\nD = Rb2CoF6 (target) — obtained by applying both changes (Cs->Rb and Cl->F) to A.  Additive approximation: a(D) ≈ a(A) + 2*(r_Rb - r_Cs) + 2*(r_F - r_Cl).  Numerically: 10.2733 -0.44 -0.96 = 8.8733 Å.  Finally include a small additional adjustment for the B-site change Mn->Co (Co is slightly smaller than Mn in typical oxidation states), estimated to contract the lattice by ~0.02–0.03 Å.  I apply Δ_M ≈ -0.02 Å, giving a final predicted cubic lattice a ≈ 8.85 Å.  \n\nVolume is then cubic volume V = a^3.
