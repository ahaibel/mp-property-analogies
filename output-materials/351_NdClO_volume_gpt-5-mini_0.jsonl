In practice I fit a and c versus chalcogen covalent radius (S, Se, Te) and extrapolated to the covalent radius of O to estimate NdOF lattice parameters. Second, I used the known halogen substitution effect F -> Cl for the Te series: NdTeF -> NdTeCl to obtain multiplicative scale factors for a and c (and therefore volume) when replacing F by Cl. I applied those F->Cl scale factors to the extrapolated NdOF values to obtain NdClO. Steps: 1) Fit a(r) and c(r) (linear least-squares) using NdSF, NdSeF, NdTeF vs chalcogen covalent radii; extrapolate to r(O) to get NdOF (a,c). 2) Compute F->Cl multipliers from NdTeF -> NdTeCl (a_ratio and c_ratio, volume ratio). 3) Multiply the extrapolated NdOF a and c by the respective ratios to get NdClO a and c, then compute volume = (sqrt(3)/2) * a^2 * c.

Observed trend: for NdXHal series (NdSF → NdSeF → NdTeF) increasing the chalcogen size increases both a and c roughly monotonically (NdSF: a=3.9422, c=6.9293; NdSeF: a=4.0364, c=7.1578; NdTeF: a=4.2125, c=7.6609). Replacing F by a larger halogen (Cl) typically produces a modest expansion of the in-plane a parameter and of c. Starting from the closest available Nd example with small chalcogen and F (NdSF: a=3.9422, c=6.9293), I assume O (smaller than S) tends to shrink the cell relative to S, while replacing F→Cl tends to expand the cell. These two effects partially compensate. Based on the magnitude of changes seen across the NdSF→NdSeF→NdTeF sequence and typical halogen-driven expansions in related compounds, I estimated a small net increase in a relative to NdSF (~+1.5%) and a modest increase in c (~+2.5%). That gives a ≈ 4.00 Å, c ≈ 7.10 Å (with a=b), leading to a tetragonal cell volume a^2·c ≈ 113.6 Å^3.

I treat the effect of changing anions from S/F to O/Cl for the same lanthanide as roughly compensating (S->O tends to shrink, F->Cl tends to expand), so the net anion substitution effect is small. Therefore I map the Pr->Sm lanthanide contraction onto the Pr->Nd (where Nd sits between Pr and Sm) change to estimate NdClO from nearby Pr/Sm SF data: choose a value intermediate between PrSF and SmSF biased toward Pr (since Nd is closer to Pr than to Sm).
