The formation energy is estimated from the standard formation enthalpy of BaSO4 (on the order of −1.4 to −1.5×10^3 kJ·mol−1) → ≈ −15.2 eV per formula unit; dividing by 6 atoms per formula unit gives ≈ −2.5 eV/atom.

  "explanation": "Crystal structure: BaSO4 (barite) is the orthorhombic Pnma (often reported Pnma, Z = 4) sulfate mineral.

I adopt representative experimental values (a = 8.884 Å, b = 5.457 Å, c = 7.154 Å) giving a unit-cell volume ≈ 346.9 Å^3. Band gap: BaSO4 is a wide-gap insulator; optical/UV measurements and higher-level calculations typically place the gap in the ≈5–6 eV range. Density-functional (GGA/PBE) calculations typically underestimate gaps, so a reasonable prediction for the experimental optical gap is ≈5.5 eV. Formation energy: using standard formation enthalpy data for BaSO4 (~ -1.46 × 10^3 kJ/mol ≈ -15.18 eV per formula unit) and dividing by 6 atoms per formula unit gives ≈ -2.53 eV/atom. DFT formation energies can differ by a few tenths of an eV/atom depending on functional and reference states; the value given is an estimate based on experimental thermochemistry. Assumptions and uncertainties: lattice parameters are taken from typical room-temperature experimental reports for barite (Pnma); the band gap is an estimated optical gap (experimental values vary and DFT underestimates are common); formation energy is derived from experimental ΔfH° converted to eV/atom and should be treated as an approximate thermochemical value rather than a specific DFT-computed formation energy.",
