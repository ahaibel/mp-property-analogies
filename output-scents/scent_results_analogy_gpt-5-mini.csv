2-Phenylethyl isothiocyanate,"Analogy: Benzyl isothiocyanate (A) is to 2-Phenylethyl isothiocyanate (B) as a sharp, short-stemmed chili is to a slightly longer-stemmed chili — i.e. the functional group that dominates odor (the isothiocyanate) stays the same, but inserting one extra CH2 between the aromatic ring and the N=C=S reduces volatility and edge a bit, producing a marginally milder, slightly warmer profile while preserving the same spicy/chemical character.

Reasoning steps:
1) Identify close structural analogue: benzyl isothiocyanate (C1=CC=CC=C1–CH2–N=C=S) is in the dataset and is chemically the same isothiocyanate functionality but directly attached via a benzyl (–CH2–) linker. 2-Phenylethyl isothiocyanate (query) has an extra methylene (–CH2–CH2–N=C=S). The isothiocyanate group drives pungent/horseradish/mustard-like, spicy and chemical impressions; the aromatic phenyl ring contributes green/vegetal/woody warmth.

2) Compare data for benzyl isothiocyanate and for other isothiocyanates in the set (e.g., 3-(methylthio)propyl isothiocyanate). Those compounds show very high strength/pungency, relatively low pleasantness, and strong ""chemical/spicy"" attributes. Strengths cluster ~68–73 and pleasantness is low (~22–30) with moderate familiarity.

3) Consider methylene spacer effect: adding a CH2 typically lowers vapor pressure/volatility and softens the immediate sharpness (so slightly lower perceived ""cold/stinging"" and slightly reduced ammonia-like bite), but does not remove the characteristic pungent/isothiocyanate impression. It can also shift perception subtly toward warmer/less biting notes (a small increase in warm/woody nuance relative to benzyl analogue).

4) Translate these structural/olfactory trends into predicted attribute magnitudes: keep high ""strength"" and ""chemical"" and ""spices""; keep low ""sweet/bakery/fruit/flower/musky""; modestly raise garlic/spice/chemical impressions relative to non-sulfur aromatics but slightly lower the extreme bite (ammonia/cold) vs benzyl isothiocyanate.

Predictions are therefore anchored to benzyl isothiocyanate but adjusted for one extra CH2 and comparisons with other isothiocyanates in the dataset.",35.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,20.0,45.0,65.0,16.0,8.0,10.0,10.0,28.0,5.0,12.0,20.0,26.0,12.0,14.0,8.0,68.0,70.0,25.0,46.0
1-Octen-3-yl acetate,"Analogy used: cis-3-hexenol is to cis-3-hexenyl acetate as 1-octen-3-ol is to 1-octen-3-yl acetate. Reasoning steps: (1) In the dataset, acetylation of an unsaturated, green/leafy alcohol (cis-3-hexenol -> cis-3-hexenyl acetate) shifts the scent away from a raw, pungent/green-alcohol character toward a more fruity/ester-like, more pleasant and slightly more familiar odor while often lowering off-notes (e.g. 'fishy', 'ammonia', 'decayed') and keeping comparable intensity. (2) 1-Octen-3-ol (dataset entry 243) has a pronounced mushroom/earthy character and moderate 'fish/decayed' ratings and moderate intensity (strength ~54), but relatively lower pleasantness (~41). (3) Applying the same transformation (acetylation) to 1-octen-3-ol is expected to reduce the free‑OH driven pungency and 'mushroomy' or 'green' sharpness, lower 'fishy' and 'ammonia' notes, and introduce / emphasize mild fruity/ester, sweet and edible cues, increasing pleasantness and familiarity moderately while leaving overall strength in the same ballpark. (4) Therefore predicted descriptor changes: decreased fish/ammonia/decayed, increased fruit/sweet/edible/pleasant, modest changes to green/grass and wood/earthy aspects remain moderate. Predictions are interpolated from nearby esters (hexenyl/other alkyl acetates) and the parent alcohol 1-octen-3-ol.",50.0,25.0,40.0,45.0,12.0,5.0,12.0,30.0,15.0,8.0,18.0,30.0,10.0,8.0,18.0,20.0,18.0,30.0,20.0,22.0,55.0,52.0,48.0
"3-Acetyl-2,5-dimethylthiophene","Analogy and reasoning steps:
A (3-acetyl-2,5-dimethylfuran) is to B (the measured ratings for that furan, entry 40) as C (2-acetylthiophene) is to D (the unknown ratings for 3-acetyl-2,5-dimethylthiophene). Rationale: the target molecule is the thiophene (sulfur) analogue of the known furan (oxygen) 3-acetyl-2,5-dimethylfuran. The most direct comparisons are therefore the furan analog (same substitution pattern, different heteroatom) and a simple acetylthiophene (2-acetylthiophene, entry 439) which captures the influence of sulfur on an acetylated heterocycle. I treat the target as primarily like the furan analog (weight ~0.6) but shifted toward thiophene-like character (weight ~0.4) because changing O→S commonly shifts aroma toward more savory/roasty/sulfurous notes and alters intensity/pleasantness.

Steps used to arrive at numeric predictions:
1) Take the ratings for 3-acetyl-2,5-dimethylfuran (entry 40) and for 2-acetylthiophene (entry 439). These provide direct empirical anchors for the O- and S-variants.
2) Compute a weighted average (0.6×furan + 0.4×thiophene) for descriptors available in both entries (fish, cold, ammonia, decayed, strength, pleasant, familiar) to capture the mixed similarity.
   - fish = 0.6*23.3333 + 0.4*41.0 ≈ 30.40
   - cold = 0.6*24.1429 + 0.4*19.25 ≈ 22.19
   - ammonia = 0.6*40.4286 + 0.4*23.7143 ≈ 33.74
   - decayed = 0.6*27.25 + 0.4*15.0 = 22.35
   - strength = 0.6*50.0 + 0.4*36.6528 ≈ 44.66
   - pleasant = 0.6*36.97297 + 0.4*48.48611 ≈ 41.58
   - familiar = 0.6*43.47297 + 0.4*43.36111 ≈ 43.43
3) For descriptors not shared in those two anchor entries (edible, bakery, sweet, fruit, garlic, spices, sour, burnt, acid, warm, musky, sweaty, wood, grass, flower, chemical), use structure–odor heuristics together with the above anchors:
   - acetyl on a small heterocycle gives buttery/bakery / caramel-like facets (so bakery/sweet/edible moderate).
   - sulfur (thiophene) biases toward savory, roasted, slight meaty or chemical notes and can raise 'fish/garlic' tendencies relative to the furan, while often slightly reducing pure floral/fruity character.
   - methyl substituents on the ring typically boost warmth/roundedness and can enhance perceived sweetness/pleasantness modestly.
   - combine these qualitative adjustments with the quantitative anchors above to assign plausible 0–100 ratings.
4) Final values are therefore the weighted empirical values where available and chemically-reasoned estimates for the remaining descriptors. Uncertainty: moderate — the predictions assume typical O→S trends and no unforeseen strong matrix interactions.

Numeric summary (calculations shown where used):
- For shared anchors I used the explicit weighted-average arithmetic shown above. For other descriptors I assigned values consistent with an acetylated, methyl-substituted thiophene (moderate bakery/sweet notes, low fruit/flower, modest sulfurous/fishy character).",45.0,48.0,42.0,12.0,30.4,18.0,30.0,22.19,15.0,24.0,18.0,42.0,18.0,14.0,33.74,22.35,20.0,18.0,18.0,26.0,44.66,41.58,43.43
Androstadienone,"Musk ketone is to a classic synthetic musk (strong, predominantly musky/animalic, low fruit/edible, moderate pleasantness) as Androstadienone is to a steroidal human-derived musk (strongly musky/animalic but more sweaty/fermented/amberic, very low fruity/sweet/bakery). Reasoning steps: (1) Identify a close functional analogue: musk ketone (a prototypical musk) represents the musky/animalic axis in the dataset. (2) Note molecular class difference: musk ketone is a nitro-aromatic musk while androstadienone is a C19 steroidal ketone — both give low volatility, persistent musky notes but steroids carry more “body/animalic/sweaty” character and fewer sweet/fruit cues. (3) Map perceptual dimensions: from musk ketone’s high musky and moderate strength/pleasantness, shift toward slightly higher sweaty/animalic and 'warm' qualities for the steroid, while lowering edible/bakery/fruit/sweet ratings. (4) Adjust other axes (chemical, decayed, ammonia) modestly upward compared to floral/green axes because steroidal human-derived compounds are often perceived as ‘chemical/animalic’ rather than fresh/green or fruity. (5) Produce numeric predictions consistent with musky-dominated, warm, moderately intense, moderately pleasant but relatively unfamiliar human-steroid odor.",3.0,2.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,8.0,10.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,55.0,78.0,56.0,18.0,22.0,20.0,3.0,12.0,45.0,68.0,52.0,28.0
Piperonyl isobutyrate,"Analogy and reasoning:
A is to B as C is to D.

A = piperonal (3,4-methylenedioxybenzaldehyde). B = piperonal's measured scent profile (notably high pleasant/familiar, floral/vanilla/balsamic character, moderate strength). Piperonal's methylenedioxy aromatic ring gives a warm, balsamic-vanillic, sweet-floral impression.

C = a benzyl/isobutyrate-type ester (i.e. a benzyl alcohol esterified with isobutyric acid). Typical benzyl esters (benzyl acetate/benzyl propionate/other benzyl esters) in the dataset show fruity/floral, sweet, bakery-like / soft ester characters with moderate pleasantness and moderate strength; esters tend to soften and sweeten aromatic notes and reduce harsh aldehydic/top-note intensity.

D = piperonyl isobutyrate (the benzyl isobutyrate where the benzyl ring carries the 3,4-methylenedioxy substitution). By the analogy: piperonal (A) -> sweet/vanilla-floral (B); a benzyl isobutyrate (C) -> sweet/fruity/esteric, so piperonyl isobutyrate (D) will combine the methylenedioxy aromatic (vanilla/heliotrope/balsamic/floral) with the soft, sweet, fruity/esteric, slightly bakery-like lift of an isobutyrate ester.

Reasoning steps used to derive numeric predictions:
1) Structural motifs: the 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl (piperonyl) contributes warm, sweet, balsamic, vanillin/heliotrope-like and floral impressions (seen in piperonal and related methylenedioxy aromatics in the dataset). 2) The benzyl–O–C(=O)–isobutyrate ester moiety attenuates sharp aldehydic notes, increases fruity/sweet/soft-gourmand facets and gives a slightly creamy/bakery character (estery). 3) Volatility/strength: esters of benzyl alcohol are moderate in odor strength and are familiar/pleasant to many; piperonyl substitution tends to be perceived as highly pleasant/familiar in the dataset. 4) Negative attributes (fish, garlic, sweaty, ammonia, decayed) are not expected because neither methylenedioxy aromatics nor benzyl esters carry typical thiol/amine/fishy signatures. 5) Some woody/resinous/vanilla warmth and floral character are anticipated; a modest spice lift may occur but not dominating.

Combining these effects leads to a profile dominated by sweet, floral/vanilla notes with estery-fruity and mild bakery/creaminess, moderate warmth and moderate strength, high pleasantness and moderate-to-high familiarity. Predicted numeric ratings follow from mapping qualitative intensities to the 0–100 scale, using piperonal and benzyl/benzyl-ester examples in the dataset as anchors.",55.0,48.0,62.0,22.0,2.0,1.0,20.0,18.0,8.0,4.0,10.0,45.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,18.0,5.0,60.0,18.0,58.0,70.0,58.0
Diethyl malate,"Analogy (with reasoning steps):

Diethyl malonate (A) is to its observed scent profile (B) as Diethyl malate (C) is to the predicted scent profile (D).

1) Identify A→B: Diethyl malonate (A) is a symmetric diethyl ester of malonate. Its measured scent profile is a mildly strong, quite pleasant, familiar ester (B) with low ‘‘off’’ notes (low fish, ammonia, decayed) and moderate strength and pleasantness (references: diethyl malonate in the dataset: low fish ~6.5, low ammonia ~4.7, strength ~44, pleasant ~67). This places it among neutral/pleasant food-like esters.

2) Structural difference C vs A: Diethyl malate (C) is closely related to diethyl malonate structurally but has a key functional-group difference: an additional hydroxyl-bearing carbon (it is the diethyl ester of malic acid, i.e. a 2-hydroxy-dicarboxylate diester). That –OH adjacent to the ester centers tends to increase polarity and can (a) enhance ‘‘fruit/sweet’’ and ‘‘sour/acidic’’ impressions in esters (many hydroxy-esters in the dataset are rated higher on fruit/sweet and somewhat on acid/sour than corresponding simple esters), and (b) slightly soften heavy ‘‘chemical’’ or sulfuric off-notes while keeping overall pleasantness.

3) Map the chemical change to perceptual shifts (B→D): therefore, using A’s profile as baseline, predict these systematic adjustments for D (diethyl malate):
   - Keep the low malodour axes (fish, ammonia, decayed) near A’s low values because no sulfur or amine groups are introduced.
   - Increase fruitiness and sweetness relative to diethyl malonate because the extra hydroxyl often gives a fresher, fruitier impression (compare hydroxy esters such as ethyl-3-hydroxybutyrate and other hydroxy/carboxylate esters in the dataset).
   - Raise ‘‘sour/acid’’ and ‘‘acid’’ perception moderately because malate is derived from an acidic, tart motif even though the molecule is esterified (esters can still carry perceived acidity/tartness from structure).
   - Leave strength in the same moderate range (esters of this size are not extremely potent) and keep pleasantness high, slightly tempered by a touch more acid/tart character.
   - Minor increases in ‘‘cold’’ or ‘‘grass/flower’’ are possible but modest; keep woody/musky/more animalic attributes low.

4) Quantitative prediction: start from diethyl malonate baseline and apply the above directional shifts to produce the predicted numeric profile for Diethyl malate (D).

Summary (A:B :: C:D): Diethyl malonate : (mild, pleasant diethyl ester with low off-notes, moderate strength, moderate familiarity) :: Diethyl malate : (similar pleasant diethyl-ester character but a touch fruitier/sweeter and modestly more sour/acidic, with low off-notes and comparable familiarity).

Acetanisole,"Analogy used to derive predictions:

I use a structural-analogy approach: replace a hydrogen on a benzene ring with a para-methoxy group and observe how odor attributes shift, then transfer that shift from a parent ketone to its para-methoxy analogue. Concretely: benzaldehyde (no methoxy) -> p-anisaldehyde (para-methoxy benzaldehyde) is my template A:B; acetophenone (phenyl methyl ketone) -> acetanisole (para-methoxy acetophenone, the query) is C:D. The chemical change (H -> para-OCH3) tends to: increase sweet/vanilla/anise-like impressions, increase edible/bakery character, increase warm/tending-sweet facets and aromatic/floral nuances, while lowering green/harsh notes and not increasing animal/foul notes. 

Stepwise reasoning:
1) Choose A:B where measured data show that introducing a para-methoxy or anisyl motif generally enhances sweet/edible/bakery/vanilla qualities (many anisole/anisyl derivatives in the dataset are judged sweeter/more bakery-like and remain pleasant). The benzaldehyde -> p-anisaldehyde pair exemplifies this transformation: the para-OCH3 shifts the aromatic aldehyde toward sweeter/anisic/warmer impressions and slightly increases pleasantness.
2) Apply analogous effect to the acetophenone -> acetanisole transformation. Acetophenone (the parent ketone) already has a mildly sweet, floral, slightly fruity/green aromatic character and moderate pleasantness in the dataset. Adding a para-methoxy (to give acetanisole) is expected to: raise edible/bakery/sweet ratings, increase warm and floral nuances, keep fish/garlic/decayed/ammonia/strong off-notes low, and moderately increase familiarity and overall pleasantness. Intensity (strength) is expected to be moderate (not extremely high) — many anisole/anisyl derivatives are of moderate strength compared with small volatile ketones.
3) I combine these qualitative shifts with magnitudes observed for related para-methoxy substitutions in the dataset (e.g., anisole, p-anisaldehyde, anisyl acetate, 3,4-dimethoxyacetophenone) to produce numeric predictions. I bias toward values typical of para-methoxy aromatic ketones: clearly sweet/bakery/edible, low on animalic/foul, moderate warmth and floral character, moderate strength and good pleasantness/familiarity.

Thus: predicted D (acetanisole) properties follow from A->B changes applied to acetophenone (C), producing the numeric estimates below.",65.0,62.0,60.0,12.0,2.0,1.0,10.0,24.0,8.0,6.0,9.0,40.0,10.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,18.0,12.0,28.0,30.0,45.0,67.0,52.0
"4,5-Dihydro-3(2H)-thiophenone","Analogy: Cyclopentanone (A) is to its odor profile (B) as 4,5-dihydro-3(2H)-thiophenone (C) is to its predicted odor profile (D).

Reasoning steps: 
1) Structural analogy: Cyclopentanone (a saturated five‑membered ring ketone) provides a baseline for a ring‑ketone odor (clean, moderate intensity, somewhat sweet/ketonic notes). Replacing one ring carbon with sulfur (making a dihydro‑thiophenone) preserves the five‑membered ring and ketone functionality but introduces a heteroatom (S) that commonly shifts odor character toward sulfurous, savory/meaty, roasted and slightly burnt notes and often increases the perception of ""chemical""/sulfur facets. Thus the target will resemble cyclopentanone in warm/ketonic backbone but will acquire sulfur-associated attributes.
2) Empirical analogy with known thiophenes and thioketones: 2‑Acetylthiophene and other substituted thiophenes in the dataset show elevated ""fish/roasted/sulfur"" and ""chemical/burnt"" descriptors compared with simple ketones, while still retaining some pleasant, savory/roasted character. For example, 3‑acetyl‑2,5‑dimethylthiophene and 2‑acetylthiophene have moderate-to-high ""fish/chemical/burnt"" scores and moderate pleasantness. Thiophene itself shows modest fish/chemical scores compared with saturated ketones. This suggests the dihydro‑thiophenone will sit between cyclopentanone and acetylated thiophenes: more sulfurous/roasted than cyclopentanone, but not as extremely volatile or pungent as small thiols.
3) Attribute mapping: therefore attributes such as ""fish"", ""garlic"", ""burnt"", ""chemical"", ""decayed"" and overall intensity/strength should be elevated relative to typical cycloalkanones; attributes like ""flower"", ""fruit"", ""bakery"", ""sweet"" should be low. ""Warm"" (ketone warmth/roasted) and moderate ""spices"" are expected. ""Pleasant"" likely moderate-to-low because sulfurous notes tend to reduce hedonic ratings for many panelists, though some find roasted/savory notes agreeable.
4) Quantitative positioning: numbers are placed on a 0–100 scale by centering on typical cyclopentanone-like values for neutral ketone attributes and shifting upward for sulfurous and chemical descriptors using the observed ranges of related thiophenes in the dataset.

Prediction summary (C is to D): 4,5‑dihydro‑3(2H)‑thiophenone will smell like a moderately intense, warm/ketonic ring note with noticeable sulfurous/meaty/roasted facets, some burnt/chemical edge, low fruity/floral/sweet/bakery characters, and a modestly low pleasantness and familiarity.",15.0,5.0,8.0,5.0,35.0,40.0,30.0,22.0,12.0,30.0,12.0,34.0,20.0,25.0,22.0,28.0,20.0,10.0,8.0,50.0,55.0,35.0,30.0
4-Ethoxybenzaldehyde,"Analogy (used to derive the numbers):
Anisole (methoxybenzene) is to p‑anisaldehyde (para‑methoxybenzaldehyde) as ethoxybenzene (ethoxy analogue of anisole) is to 4‑ethoxybenzaldehyde. 
Reasoning steps: 
1) From the dataset anisole (a methoxy‑substituted benzene) is aromatic, somewhat sweet/anisic and fairly pleasant; p‑anisaldehyde (the same aromatic ring but with an added para‑aldehyde) is noticeably more ""bready/sweet/pleasant"" and somewhat stronger — introducing the aldehyde adds warm, bakery/almond/anisic character and raises pleasantness and perceived strength. 
2) Replacing the methoxy (–OCH3) by an ethoxy (–OCH2CH3) typically gives a very similar odor quality but slightly reduced volatility, a touch more oily/warm/vanilla‑like character, and a modest decrease in immediate headspace intensity. Thus the ethoxy analogue will qualitatively resemble the methoxy analogue but be a bit less sharp and slightly warmer. 
3) Combine these two transformations: take the p‑anisaldehyde profile as the primary template (high bakery/sweet/pleasant, moderate strength, low off‑notes) then (a) shift a little toward lower volatility/intensity (slightly lower ""strength""), (b) slightly increase warm/vanilla/creamy impressions, and (c) keep low values for sulfurous/garlic/fishy notes. Small increases in ""woody/warm"" and modest reductions in perceived familiarity/intensity reflect the ethoxy substitution. 
4) Numerical values are estimated by using p‑anisaldehyde / anisole / benzaldehyde / related anisic/aldehydic entries as anchors and applying the small adjustments above to generate the predicted 0–100 ratings for 4‑ethoxybenzaldehyde.

Predictions (4‑Ethoxybenzaldehyde):
- edible: aromatic anisic aldehydes are used in flavoring; moderately edible impression expected → 58.0
- bakery: strong bakery/almond/vanilla character from para‑aldehyde → 65.0
- sweet: clear sweet/anisic impression but slightly less candy‑sweet than smaller methoxy analogue → 60.0
- fruit: not fruity (aromatic almond/anise dominates) → 20.0
- fish: very low (no sulfuric/fishy features) → 10.0
- garlic: negligible (no thiols) → 5.0
- spices: mild‑moderate (warm, slightly spicy aromatic) → 35.0
- cold: mild cool/volatile top‑note comparable to anisic aldehydes but slightly reduced → 24.0
- sour: low → 10.0
- burnt: low (not pyrolytic) → 8.0
- acid: low (perceived acidity not prominent) → 10.0
- warm: moderate‑high (ethoxy adds a warmer, slightly creamier tone) → 50.0
- musky: low → 8.0
- sweaty: very low → 5.0

ethylbenzene,"Analogy and reasoning steps:

Benzene (simple aromatic hydrocarbon) is to its measured odor profile (low pleasantness, solvent/chemical character, modest strength) as ethylbenzene (benzene with an ethyl substituent) is to a similar profile shifted by the predictable effect of alkyl substitution on an aromatic hydrocarbon. Stepwise mapping used to make the prediction: 
1) Base reference: use the benzene entry in the dataset (low 'pleasant', appreciable 'chemical', modest 'strength', low food/fruit/bakery metrics) as the anchor for unsubstituted aromatic hydrocarbon odor. 
2) Known structural effect: adding an alkyl group (methyl → toluene, ethyl → ethylbenzene) typically increases hydrocarbon/solvent character, often increases perceived odor strength and a slightly sweeter/aromatic note while remaining predominantly chemical/solvent-like rather than fruity/edible. 
3) Empirical adjustment: compared to benzene, ethylbenzene is expected to be somewhat stronger, more 'chemical', slightly sweeter/aromatic but still not pleasant in a food sense; edible/bakery/fruit/garlic/spices remain near zero. Warm/wood/flower/grass remain low-to-moderate (small aromatic warmth), ammonia/sweaty/musky/decayed remain low. Familiar should be moderate (common industrial/solvent odor). 
4) Quantitative mapping: start from benzene numeric tendencies in dataset and shift them according to the above (increase strength and chemical ratings strongly; increase sweet a little; leave food-related descriptors near zero; keep ammonia/decay low). 

Using that analogy and stepwise adjustment yields the following predicted perceptual ratings for ethylbenzene.",5.0,2.0,20.0,3.0,10.0,2.0,5.0,14.0,5.0,8.0,4.0,12.0,5.0,5.0,20.0,7.0,12.0,6.0,8.0,88.0,45.0,25.0,55.0
benzyl alcohol,"Analogy used (A is to B as C is to D):

A = 2‑phenylethanol (an aromatic primary alcohol: C6H5–CH2–CH2–OH) is to B = phenethyl acetate (its corresponding acetate ester) as C = benzyl alcohol (C6H5–CH2–OH, the query) is to D = benzyl acetate (its corresponding acetate ester).

Reasoning steps and calculations:
1) Rationale for the analogy: converting an alcohol to its acetate often changes intensity, perceived “ammonia/harsh” notes, and some aspects like sweetness/fruitiness and familiarity in reasonably systematic ways. 2‑Phenylethanol and phenethyl acetate are a directly analogous alcohol/ester pair with measured ratings in the dataset; benzyl acetate is available in the dataset, while benzyl alcohol is the molecule to predict. Thus I use the difference (alcohol minus ester) for the phenethyl pair as an initial transform, then apply that transform to benzyl acetate to get a first estimate for benzyl alcohol.

2) Compute deltas (2‑phenylethanol – phenethyl acetate), using the available attributes in the table:
- fish: 1.0 – 2.0 = -1.0
- cold: 25.0 – 24.7857 = +0.2143
- ammonia: 32.9167 – 15.5455 = +17.3712
- decayed: 9.7143 – 18.125 = -8.4107
- strength: 65.0571 – 53.02299 = +12.0341
- pleasant: 57.6857 – 55.6437 = +2.0420
- familiar: 61.8286 – 56.4943 = +5.3343

3) Apply those deltas to benzyl acetate (the known C6H5CH2–OCOCH3 entry) to produce an initial estimate for benzyl alcohol:
(benzyl acetate values from dataset: fish=1.0, cold=24.9048, ammonia=36.0909, decayed=13.8750, strength=51.6735, pleasant=57.6939, familiar=47.4898)
- fish: 1.0 + (-1.0) = 0.0 → floor to ~1.0 (practically “very low”)
- cold: 24.9048 + 0.2143 = 25.1191
- ammonia: 36.0909 + 17.3712 = 53.4621
- decayed: 13.8750 + (-8.4107) = 5.4643
- strength: 51.6735 + 12.0341 = 63.7076
- pleasant: 57.6939 + 2.0420 = 59.7359
- familiar: 47.4898 + 5.3343 = 52.8241

4) Chemical/olfactory correction using additional analogs and domain knowledge:
- The ester→alcohol deltas from the phenethyl pair produce an anomalously high ammonia score (≈53) for benzyl alcohol. In practice benzyl alcohol is not ammonia‑like; comparable aromatics (benzaldehyde, alpha‑methylbenzyl alcohol) show low–moderate ammonia (≈9–16). Therefore I reduce ammonia from the naïve 53.5 down to ~16 (consistent with benzaldehyde and aromatic alcohol entries).
- Strength: the ester→alcohol delta predicted a fairly high strength (~64); however known simple aromatic alcohols (alpha‑methylbenzyl alcohol strength ≈39, benzaldehyde ≈61) suggest benzyl alcohol is moderate in strength. I set strength to ~45 (midway between small aromatic alcohol and benzaldehyde).
- Pleasantness and familiarity: benzyl alcohol is generally described as mildly pleasant, floral/balsamic; the naïve estimate (~59.7 pleasant, ~52.8 familiar) is reasonable, so I keep pleasant ≈60 and familiar ≈52.
- Decayed, fish, garlic, sweaty, and other off‑notes: keep very low (≤10) because benzyl alcohol is clean, not sulfurous or cheesy.
- Floral/sweet/bakery/fruit/wood/chemical: use structural/semantic analogies to aromatic alcohols (2‑phenylethanol has high floral; benzyl alcohol is floral but less rose‑like than phenethyl alcohol). I therefore assign a strong flower score (~65), modest sweet (~35), modest bakery (~25), low fruit (~20), light woody/support (~25), and low “chemical” harshness (~20).

5) Final predicted profile (0–100 scale) — balanced between the data-driven transform and chemical intuition/other analogs: these values are my best estimate for benzyl alcohol.

Notes: the analytic analogy (alcohol↔ester) produced a useful starting point; I moderated attributes that would be chemically implausible (notably ammonia) using direct comparisons to benzaldehyde and alpha‑methylbenzyl alcohol and to general olfactory descriptions of benzyl alcohol (mild, sweet‑floral, slightly balsamic).",35.0,25.0,35.0,20.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,25.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,35.0,10.0,5.0,16.0,6.0,25.0,15.0,65.0,20.0,45.0,60.0,52.0
benzaldehyde,"Anisole is to p-anisaldehyde as benzyl alcohol is to benzaldehyde. Reasoning steps: (1) Anisole (an aromatic ether) and benzyl alcohol (an aromatic alcohol) are relatively mild, floral/phenolic/aromatic molecules. Converting an electron-donating aromatic substituent to an aldehyde (anisole -> p-anisaldehyde; benzyl alcohol -> benzaldehyde) typically increases almond/cherry/fruit-like aldehydic character, raises perceived sweetness/edible/bakery impressions and overall odor pleasantness and recognizability, and often increases a clean, characteristic chemical note (more 'aldehydic' chemical character). (2) Compare anisole -> p-anisaldehyde in the dataset: the aldehyde analogue shows much higher pleasant/familiar/almost confectionary attributes while retaining aromatic character. Using that transformation as a template, start from benzyl alcohol's aromatic, mildly sweet/floral baseline and adjust toward stronger almond/fruit/edible/bakery attributes while reducing any overly fatty/green/grassy notes. (3) Apply plausible quantitative shifts observed in the anisole→p-anisaldehyde example (large positive shift in pleasantness/familiarity/sweet/edible/bakery; small to moderate increase in 'chemical' and 'strength') to estimate benzaldehyde's profile. (4) Also use known chemoperceptual knowledge: benzaldehyde is classically described as almond / marzipan / cherry-like, used as a flavoring — so edible/bakery/sweet/fruit should be clearly above average; fish/garlic/sweaty/ammonia/decayed/musky should be near zero. The following numeric ratings (0-100) are the result of that analogy-driven adjustment and domain knowledge.",72.0,60.0,62.0,50.0,2.0,1.0,15.0,8.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,35.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,12.0,5.0,18.0,35.0,65.0,78.0,80.0
anisole,"Analogy and reasoning steps:
A is p-anisaldehyde / anisyl acetate family (ring with a methoxy plus a heavier functional group) : B is anisyl acetate / acetanisole (heavier, more 'sweet/vanilla/bakery' and more familiar/strong) as C is anisole (simple methoxybenzene) : D is predicted perceptual profile (what we want).
Reasoning steps: 1) Anisole (methoxybenzene, COC1=CC=CC=C1) is the simplest methoxy-substituted benzene; removing larger substituents (aldehyde, acetate, acetyl, para-methyl) reduces both intensity and the strong sweet/vanilla/bakery character while preserving a sweet, aromatic, slightly floral/anise-like quality. 2) Use closest entries in the dataset as anchors: 4-methylanisole (entry 30) and acetanisole (entry 6) and anisyl acetate (entry 26) and p-anisaldehyde (entry 141). Those compounds share the methoxy-aryl core but carry extra groups that raise strength, bakery and pleasant ratings. 3) Interpolate: anisole should be less intense than acetanisole and 4-methylanisole in some warming/bakery dimensions, but still carry moderate sweetness, aromatic/floral character and familiarity. It will score low on fish/garlic/ammonia/decayed notes and low on sweaty/musky. It will have modest ‘chemical’ aroma character compared with heavier substituted anisoles.
Numerical approach: for each perceptual axis I compared the values for 4-methylanisole, acetanisole and anisyl acetate and placed anisole roughly mid- to lower-range relative to those anchors (leaning lower for bakery/strength than acetanisole, but moderate for pleasant/familiar since simple methoxy-aromatics are generally agreeable). The following are the predicted scores for anisole (0-100):",35.0,25.0,50.0,10.0,2.0,1.0,20.0,24.0,10.0,5.0,8.0,30.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,12.0,12.0,8.0,30.0,30.0,50.0,55.0,50.0
Methyl phenylacetate,"Analogy (A is to B as C is to D) and stepwise reasoning:

A = Phenethyl acetate (known; fruity/flowery, pleasant, moderate strength)
B = Phenethyl phenylacetate (known; same alcohol part as A but the acetate acyl replaced by the bulkier phenylacetate; pleasantness and “fruity” character drop and the scent becomes more aromatic/less bright)

C = Methyl benzoate (known; small aromatic methyl ester, floral/honeylike, moderate pleasantness)
D = Methyl phenylacetate (unknown; methyl ester of phenylacetic acid — the target of prediction)

Analogy statement: Phenethyl acetate is to phenethyl phenylacetate as methyl benzoate is to methyl phenylacetate.

Rationale and transfer of observed changes (A -> B) to estimate C -> D:
1) What the A->B change represents structurally: replacing a simple acetyl (–COCH3) or simple acetate linkage by a phenylacetyl-type fragment (an aromatic-substituted acyl group or moving the phenyl one atom further from the carbonyl) tends to reduce bright, fruity acetyl character, shift odor toward more generic aromatic/phenyl notes, and often reduce the transient “sweet/fruity” impression and sometimes alter intensity. We observe this in the A->B pair as a sizable drop in fruity/sweet/pleasant ratings and a shift toward more floral/aromatic/chemical impression.

2) How to apply this to the methyl series: Methyl benzoate is a small, volatile aromatic methyl ester (bright floral/honey). Replacing the benzoate arrangement by a phenylacetate motif (i.e., methyl phenylacetate) keeps the aromatic character but generally moderates the bright acetate-like fruitiness and can make the aroma slightly rounder and more honey/flower-like but not necessarily more pleasant in the same way as simple acetates. Therefore, I transfer the direction of the A->B changes to C but attenuate the magnitude because methyl benzoate is smaller and already ester-floral; the structural change will be noticeable but less extreme than for the longer-chain phenethyl series.

3) Attribute-by-attribute transfer logic (numbers are derived by applying the observed A->B directional change to C with moderation/scaling when extreme changes would be implausible):
- Edible: phenethyl acetate is a flavor ester; phenylacetate variants are still edible but less candy/fruit-like. For methyl phenylacetate I predict a moderately high edible perception as it is used in flavors (apply a small reduction from a canonical ester): ~45.
- Bakery & Sweet & Fruit: the acetate esters are brighter/fruitier; replacing by phenylacetate reduces fruit/bright sweetness. So reduce fruit/bakery/sweet relative to a bright methyl ester but keep floral/honey sweetness. Bakery low (20), sweet moderate (45), fruit modest (30).
- Fish/Garlic/Ammonia/Decayed/Sweaty: phenylacetates are not sulfurous or fishy; keep these low. fish~2, garlic~1–2, ammonia~12 (low), sweaty~4, decayed~18 (low-to-moderate background level seen for many aromatics).
- Spices/Warm/Wood/Grass: small aromatic esters show some warm/woody/aromatic background. Give low-to-moderate: spices 10, warm 28, wood 22, grass 18.
- Cold/Sour/Burnt/Acid/Chemical: cold and chemical impressions are modest for aromatic methyl esters; acid (sour) modest. cold 26, sour 10, burnt 5, acid 16, chemical 30 (some solvent/aromatic chemical note due to aromatic ester character).
- Musky: low (8).
- Flower: preserved and somewhat emphasized (phenylacetates are often floral/honey-like). Flower is one of the stronger dimensions for methyl phenylacetate; predict high floral rating ~62.
- Strength: methyl benzoate is fairly volatile but not extremely strong; phenylacetate substitution tends to keep moderate intensity. Predict moderate strength ~35 (noticeable but not overpowering).
- Pleasant & Familiar: based on the A->B direction (acetate -> phenylacetate often reduces the bright fruity pleasantness) and methyl benzoate baseline, predict a modest drop in pleasantness from methyl benzoate. Methyl benzoate pleasantness is moderate; methyl phenylacetate should be still pleasant but not as candy-fruity. Pleasant ~38. Familiar (encountered in some floral/food contexts) moderate ~40.

Summary: using the structural analogy (replace simple acetate/benzoate motif by a phenylacetate motif) and transferring the observed A->B changes to C with attenuation gives the numeric predictions below.",45.0,20.0,45.0,30.0,2.0,1.0,10.0,26.0,10.0,5.0,16.0,28.0,8.0,4.0,12.0,18.0,22.0,18.0,62.0,30.0,35.0,38.0,40.0
Diphenyl ether,"Analogy used:
I used a structural-analogy approach: ""Benzene is to anisole as biphenyl is to diphenyl ether."" Rationale: anisole is benzene with an oxygen-containing substituent (a methoxy group) and shows how introduction of an ether/oxygen functionality modifies an aromatic hydrocarbon's odor profile. Biphenyl (two rings joined directly) -> diphenyl ether (two rings joined through an O atom) is the same type of oxygen-perturbation at a larger, diaryl scale. I therefore started from the measured benzene→anisole changes in the dataset and applied a moderated fraction of those changes to the biphenyl baseline to predict diphenyl ether. This gives a systematic, chemically grounded transform: oxygen-linking tends to increase intensity/‘‘chemical’’ character in this dataset while shifting some sensory dimensions (cold/ammonia/decay) upward and having mixed effects on pleasantness.

Steps and numeric reasoning (key attributes only):
1) Extracted dataset values:
   - Benzene: fish=42.0, cold=13.571, ammonia=20.286, decayed=6.75, strength=15.167, pleasant=46.083, familiar=26.688
   - Anisole: fish=22.6, cold=28.333, ammonia=28.333, decayed=21.0, strength=59.795, pleasant=36.614, familiar=41.651
   - Biphenyl: fish=8.0, cold=20.708, ammonia=27.765, decayed=14.4, strength=58.574, pleasant=39.628, familiar=39.915
2) Compute benzene→anisole deltas (anisole minus benzene):
   - fish: -19.4, cold: +14.762, ammonia: +8.048, decayed: +14.25, strength: +44.629, pleasant: -9.469, familiar: +14.963
3) Transfer to biphenyl→diphenyl-ether using a moderated scaling factor (I used 0.60 of the benzene→anisole shift to avoid over-extrapolation):
   - fish: 8.0 + (-19.4*0.6) = 8.0 -11.64 → floored to 1.0 (very low)
   - cold: 20.708 + (14.762*0.6) = 20.708 + 8.857 = 29.565
   - ammonia: 27.765 + (8.048*0.6) = 27.765 + 4.829 = 32.594
   - decayed: 14.4 + (14.25*0.6) = 14.4 + 8.55 = 22.95
   - strength: 58.574 + (44.629*0.6) = 58.574 + 26.777 = 85.351
   - pleasant: 39.628 + (-9.469*0.6) = 39.628 - 5.681 = 33.947
   - familiar: 39.915 + (14.963*0.6) = 39.915 + 8.978 = 48.893
4) For sensory dimensions not directly available from the benzene→anisole pair (edible, bakery, sweet, fruit, garlic, spices, sour, burnt, acid, warm, musky, sweaty, wood, grass, flower, chemical), I used the following secondary analogy reasoning: diaryl aromatics (biphenyl, benzophenone, other diaryl compounds in the set) tend to be relatively ‘‘chemical/woody/medicinal’’ with moderate-to-high intensity; insertion of an ether oxygen typically nudges them toward slightly more floral/phenolic/chemical notes and usually increases intensity. I therefore started from a modest biphenyl-like baseline and shifted those dimensions consistent with the direction and magnitude observed above (but conservatively scaled). This produced the numerical estimates below.

Uncertainty note: this is a reasoned interpolation using close structural analogues in the dataset; absolute values may vary in experimental panels, but the directional trends and relative magnitudes are expected to be plausible given the chemical change (aryl–aryl bond → aryl–O–aryl ether).

Final predicted values (numbers are the results of the analogy + conservative scaling described):",15.0,8.0,28.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,12.0,29.565,5.0,9.0,8.0,30.0,28.0,12.0,32.594,22.95,35.0,10.0,36.0,56.0,85.351,33.947,48.893
"1,3-Diphenyl-2-propanone","Analogy: Benzophenone (A) is to 1,3‑diphenyl‑2‑propanone (B) as acetophenone (C) is to propiophenone (D).

Reasoning steps used in the analogy and to generate the numbers:
1) Structural mapping: Benzophenone is a rigid diaryl ketone (Ar–CO–Ar). 1,3‑Diphenyl‑2‑propanone (dibenzyl ketone, Ph–CH2–CO–CH2–Ph) is the diaryl ketone in which each aryl is separated from the carbonyl by a methylene (–CH2–). The A→B change is therefore introducing an extra CH2 spacer (more conformational freedom, slightly lower volatility, a bit more alkyl/‘softening’ character).
2) Analogous change: acetophenone (C: Ph–CO–CH3) → propiophenone (D: Ph–CO–CH2–CH3) is the simpler, single‑aryl example of inserting one extra CH2 on the aliphatic side of a carbonyl. Empirically that change often shifts perception slightly: a bit warmer, sweeter, less sharp/‘cold’/volatile, and modestly fuller/rounder aroma with more bakery/balmy facets and mildly reduced “chemical”/strident top notes.
3) Transfer of trends: I apply the qualitative effect observed in the monoaryl case (C→D) to the diaryl case (A→B). Thus relative to benzophenone, 1,3‑diphenyl‑2‑propanone should be slightly less ‘cold/green’ and slightly more ‘warm/sweet/bakery/edible’, with comparable aromatic/chemical character but softened. Strength (olfactive impact) remains moderate–somewhat elevated due to two aromatic rings but slightly broadened (less piercing) because of flexibility.
4) Eliminate likely attributes: the molecule has no sulfur, amine, or obvious rotten/fishy functional groups, so high fish/garlic/ammonia/decayed/sweaty ratings are unlikely. Aromatic and ketone notes suggest floral/chemical/woody/vanilla‑like nuances rather than fruity or acidic sourness.
5) Anchoring to dataset examples: benzophenone in the provided dataset is moderate in strength and pleasantness (strength ≈50, pleasant ≈45). Acetophenone is somewhat stronger/warmer/sweeter (strength ≈66, pleasant ≈52). Using the C→D qualitative trend (adding CH2 makes the aroma warmer/sweeter and a touch less “cold”) and applying it to benzophenone gives predicted shifts for 1,3‑diphenyl‑2‑propanone: increased bakery/sweet/edible/warm, slightly reduced cold and harsh chemical note, moderate wood/flower, low foul attributes.
6) Final numerical predictions below are my best quantitative translation of the qualitative analogy and the dataset anchors (benzophenone, acetophenone and similar aromatic ketones). They reflect moderate strength, moderately pleasant, recognizable (but not highly familiar) aromatic sweet/bakery character.",48.0,58.0,54.0,8.0,6.0,5.0,22.0,26.0,10.0,12.0,10.0,42.0,18.0,8.0,12.0,14.0,34.0,18.0,38.0,36.0,55.0,50.0,44.0
Isobutyl phenylacetate,"Analogy (with reasoning steps):
A is isobutyl acetate (an isobutyl ester of acetic acid) and B is isobutyl benzoate (an isobutyl ester of benzoic acid). Comparing A→B shows what happens when the small aliphatic acyl group (acetate) is replaced by a larger aromatic acyl group (benzoate): pleasantness tends to drop a little, the character shifts from bright/fruity to more aromatic/phenolic, and intensity (strength) stays similar or modestly high.  

C is methyl phenylacetate (a small-alkyl phenylacetate) and D is the query, isobutyl phenylacetate (same phenylacetate acyl part but with a larger, branched isobutyl alcohol fragment). Methyl phenylacetate (C) is known to be a sweet/flowery phenylacetate with moderate–high odor intensity; switching the alcohol side from methyl→(larger branched isobutyl) typically: (a) reduces volatility (so intensity/strength often decreases from the methyl parent), (b) shifts the odor toward rounder, slightly fruitier/less sharp top notes, and (c) can increase ester-like fruity/edible impressions relative to a straight phenylacetate only if the alcohol fragment is ester-like (isobutyl esters are often perceived as fruity/ripe).  

Combine the two analogies: the effect of replacing acetate→benzoate (A→B) teaches how an aromatic acyl group modulates an isobutyl ester (more aromatic/less purely fruity); the effect of increasing alkyl size in a phenylacetate series (C→D) teaches how going from small alkyl (methyl) to branched isobutyl moderates intensity and enhances fruity/edible roundness while keeping the phenylacetate floral/almond-honey character.  

Therefore: isobutyl phenylacetate (D) should present as a moderately intense ester with a prominent floral/phenylacetate (honey/rose) character, noticeable sweetness and edible/fruity impression, low off-notes (fish/garlic/ammonia/decay), modest warmth, and moderate familiarity/pleasantness. Predicted ratings below reflect those combined trends and interpolation between closely related compounds in the dataset (methyl phenylacetate, butyl phenylacetate, isobutyl acetate, isobutyl benzoate).",54.0,28.0,58.0,45.0,6.0,4.0,14.0,29.0,10.0,4.0,14.0,32.0,8.0,5.0,10.0,9.0,18.0,14.0,60.0,18.0,50.0,52.0,50.0
Benzyl phenylacetate,"Methyl benzoate is to Benzyl benzoate as Methyl phenylacetate is to Benzyl phenylacetate. Reasoning steps: (1) Establish the structural/functional analogy: both pairs are esters where the alcohol side is changed from a small alkyl (methyl) to a benzyl group, increasing molecular weight and reducing volatility while adding an aromatic benzyl character. (2) Observe the effect in the benzoate pair in the dataset: methyl benzoate -> benzyl benzoate increases perceived strength (25.5 -> 42.0) and keeps a pleasant, floral/resinous profile. (3) Observe the effect of lengthening/arming the alcohol side in the phenylacetate series: methyl phenylacetate is high in floral/sweet character and high apparent strength (methyl phenylacetate strength ~64), while larger oxygen-linked aryl/alkyl substitutions (e.g., phenethyl phenylacetate) reduce volatility and lower measured strength (~34). (4) Combine these trends: replacing the small methyl group on phenylacetate with a benzyl group should lower volatility relative to the methyl ester (so strength will drop from methyl phenylacetate) but benzyl’s aromatic contribution tends to preserve or even enhance floral/balsamic/pleasant qualities (as seen for benzyl benzoate). (5) Predict qualitative profile by analogy: compared with methyl phenylacetate expect reduced raw intensity but maintained or increased floral/sweet/pleasant character and moderate familiarity. (6) Translate qualitative expectations to numeric ratings by interpolating similar compounds in the dataset (methyl phenylacetate, benzyl benzoate, benzyl acetate, phenethyl phenylacetate). The resulting predictions for benzyl phenylacetate reflect a strongly floral, sweet, and pleasant ester of moderate strength and familiarity.",36.0,28.0,52.0,22.0,2.0,1.0,14.0,29.0,12.0,5.0,18.0,36.0,22.0,10.0,20.0,20.0,26.0,12.0,72.0,30.0,42.0,60.0,50.0
Phenethyl phenylacetate,"Analogy: Benzyl phenylacetate is to Benzyl acetate as Phenethyl phenylacetate is to Phenethyl acetate.

Reasoning steps:
1) Identify the molecular change: Benzyl vs phenethyl (adds one CH2 in the alcohol side) and acetate vs phenylacetate (replacing a small acetate group by the larger, more aromatic phenylacetate). To estimate properties of phenethyl phenylacetate we take the observed effect of changing the acid from acetate to phenylacetate for the benzyl series and apply the same change to the phenethyl acetate baseline.

2) Measured pair used: Benzyl phenylacetate (dataset entry 17) vs Benzyl acetate (entry 171). Compute the deltas for the descriptors that are tabulated in the dataset: fish (+32.0), cold (~+0.5), ammonia (-9.46), decayed (+8.85), strength (-3.33), pleasant (-21.03), familiar (-2.12).

3) Apply these deltas to Phenethyl acetate (entry 23) to estimate corresponding descriptors for Phenethyl phenylacetate:
   - fish: 2.0 + 32.0 = 34.0
   - cold: 24.79 + 0.5 = 25.29
   - ammonia: 15.55 - 9.46 = 6.08
   - decayed: 18.13 + 8.85 = 26.98
   - strength: 53.02 - 3.33 = 49.69
   - pleasant: 55.64 - 21.03 = 34.61
   - familiar: 56.49 - 2.12 = 54.37

4) For other sensory axes not directly in that numeric pair (edible, bakery, sweet, fruit, garlic, spices, sour, burnt, acid, warm, musky, sweaty, wood, grass, flower, chemical) I used the same chemical reasoning: phenethyl (a floral/rose-associated 2-phenylethyl fragment) gives floral/sweet character; replacing acetate with phenylacetate tends to add a heavier, more aromatic/benzylated character, reduce simple fruity/sweet brightness and overall pleasantness, and slightly increase animalic/""off""/decay-like facets (as seen for the benzyl pair). Values below reflect that mapping (i.e., start from a phenethyl-acetate-like baseline: floral, sweet, moderately edible; then shift toward heavier, less sugary, slightly more ""phenyl/animalic"" character). Numerical estimates are rounded to reasonable precision.

Summary: applied the benzyl-acetate -> benzyl-phenylacetate delta to the phenethyl-acetate baseline, and adjusted other axes by chemical/olfactory analogy (phenethyl = floral/rosy; phenylacetate = heavier, more aromatic, slightly less sweet/pleasant).",35.0,12.0,44.0,28.0,34.0,4.5,20.0,25.29,10.0,5.0,12.0,42.0,20.0,5.0,6.08,26.98,22.0,9.0,55.0,32.0,49.69,34.61,54.37
Triacetin,"Analogy: Ethyl acetate is to a sharp, fruity/solvent acetate odor as triacetin (glycerol triacetate) is to a much milder, oily/neutral acetate odor. Reasoning steps: (1) Ethyl acetate and other small alkyl acetates (e.g., ethyl, methyl acetates in the dataset) are volatile, give fruity/solvent notes and score high on 'fruit'/'chemical' and often high strength. (2) Triacetin is the triester of glycerol with acetic acid: it is larger, less volatile, more viscous and used as a food additive (EDIBLE solvent/plasticizer) and as a flavor carrier. Larger, less volatile esters in the dataset (triethyl citrate, tributyrin, triesters and longer-chain esters) trend toward lower volatile fruity intensity, lower 'fruit' and 'strength' scores, but higher 'warm', 'fatty/bakery' and 'edible' associations and relatively pleasant, familiar ratings. (3) Therefore by analogy: Ethyl acetate : (sharp fruity, high strength, higher 'chemical') :: Triacetin : (muted, creamy/fatty, lower strength, higher 'edible' and 'warm/bakery'). (4) Map these qualitative expectations to numeric ratings guided by similar examples in the dataset (triethyl citrate, tributyrin, glycerol) — triacetin should have high edible, moderate bakery/sweet, low fruit/foul notes, modest warm/pleasant and relatively low strength/chemical. Predicted numeric ratings below reflect that analogy and interpolation from compounds of similar structure and function.",75.0,45.0,42.0,12.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,18.0,8.0,4.0,10.0,38.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,25.0,28.0,58.0,52.0
dimethyl benzene propanol,"Analogy (A is to B as C is to D) and stepwise reasoning:

A = 2-phenylethanol (aromatic primary alcohol with short two-carbon linker to ring) is to B = high floral/pleasant, moderately strong, familiar scent (rose-like), because the free benzylic/benzenoid alcohol motif and short chain favour floral/rosy notes and good pleasantness. 

A' = 3-phenyl-1-propanol (same phenyl‑alcohol motif but one extra CH2 in the side chain) is to B' = noticeably less floral and a bit less pleasant/less “rose” than 2-phenylethanol (dataset: 2‑phenylethanol shows stronger floral/pleasant ratings than 3‑phenylpropanol). This demonstrates that chain length away from the ring reduces the fresh floral character and shifts toward more generic aromatic/woody/alcoholic notes.

C = dimethyl benzene propanol (interpreted as a phenyl‑propanol where the aromatic ring bears two methyl substituents — i.e., a dimethylphenyl‑1‑propanol) is analogous to A'/3‑phenyl‑1‑propanol but with additional ring methylation. 

Therefore: C is to D as A' is to B' modified by the effect of methyl substitution on the ring. Methyl substituents on the aromatic ring typically: (1) increase hydrophobicity, (2) reduce pure floral/rose character (electron donating alkyls blunt the phenyl‑alcohol “rose” impression), (3) increase warm/woody, resinous or oily aspects and often increase perceived “strength” or body slightly, and (4) can increase sweet/waxy notes modestly. The extra propanol chain (vs 2‑phenylethanol) already reduces floral character; adding two methyls further shifts scent toward warm/woody/alcoholic/aromatic with moderate pleasantness rather than strong rosy floral.

Predicted qualitative mapping from analogy:
- Floral/sweet/pleasant attributes will be lower than 2‑phenylethanol but similar or slightly higher than 3‑phenyl‑1‑propanol for wood/warm/chemical notes.
- Strength remains moderate (not extremely pungent) because it is an aromatic primary alcohol; methyls may slightly boost body.
- Familiarity moderate (a substituted aromatic alcohol is recognizable but less common than 2‑phenylethanol).

Numeric predictions (0–100) for dimethylbenzene‑propanol (interpreted as a dimethylphenyl‑1‑propanol):
- edible: 35 — moderately edible/foodlike because aromatic alcohols are often perceived as mildly edible/sweet but not strongly so.
- bakery: 12 — low bakery/bready character.
- sweet: 28 — some sweet/waxy impression due to alkylation but not dominant.
- fruit: 18 — weak fruity association.
- fish: 5 — very low fishy character.
- garlic: 2 — negligible garlic.
- spices: 18 — mild spicy/benzoic aromatic nuance possible.
- cold: 28 — mild cool/volatile impression (alcoholic/cooling) similar to other small aromatic alcohols.
- sour: 10 — low sourness.
- burnt: 5 — negligible burnt/char notes.
- acid: 12 — low acidic note (some sharpness from alcohol functional group sometimes perceived as slightly sour/sharp).
- warm: 42 — moderately warm/woody/resinous shift from methyl substitution.
- musky: 20 — a modest background muskiness from hydrophobic aromatic character.
- sweaty: 5 — low sweaty character.
- ammonia: 20 — mild solventy/amine‑like alcoholic volatility (not strongly ammoniacal).
- decayed: 8 — low decayed/putrid character.
- wood: 38 — moderate woody/vanillic/cedary impression due to alkylated aromatic ring.
- grass: 12 — weak green/leafy note.
- flower: 40 — moderate floral but reduced compared with pure phenylethanol; still some floral from phenyl‑alcohol motif.
- chemical: 25 — some chemical/solvent facet from aromatic alcohol.
- strength: 50 — moderate overall intensity (aromatic alcohols are noticeable but not extremely pungent).
- pleasant: 50 — moderately pleasant: less than classical rose alcohols but overall acceptable, slightly warm/woody sweet.
- familiar: 45 — moderately familiar; recognizable as an aromatic alcohol but not a very common household scent.

Confidence note: these values are approximate and depend on the exact isomer (positions of the two methyls on the ring and the attachment position of the propanol chain). Isomeric differences (ortho vs para methyls) can shift floral vs medicinal/woody balance by ±10–15 points for some attributes.",35.0,12.0,28.0,18.0,5.0,2.0,18.0,28.0,10.0,5.0,12.0,42.0,20.0,5.0,20.0,8.0,38.0,12.0,40.0,25.0,50.0,50.0,45.0

A = hexyl acetate (a straight-chain C6 acetate ester with known sensory ratings). B = hexyl acetate's measured ratings in the table (baseline fruity, moderately strong, pleasant).
C = 2-ethylhexyl acetate (the query). D = predicted ratings for 2-ethylhexyl acetate.
Reasoning steps:
1) Structural analogy: both hexyl acetate (A) and 2-ethylhexyl acetate (C) are acetate esters (same functional group) so they share the same qualitative odor family (fruity/ester-like). Thus hexyl acetate's sensory profile is an appropriate baseline.
2) Effect of chain length and branching: 2-ethylhexyl acetate has a longer effective carbon skeleton (branched C8) compared with hexyl acetate (straight C6). Increasing chain length and branching typically reduces volatility, gives a fuller/waxy or slightly fatty character, can mildly deepen/warm the note, and can slightly increase perceived persistence (strength) while sometimes slightly muting the bright, top-note fruitiness.
3) Comparison with other esters in the dataset: straight medium esters like hexyl acetate are rated high on fruit/pleasant. Branched longer alkyl acetates in the dataset often show modestly higher strength and similar or slightly lower ""sharp"" fruity top-note but retain high pleasantness. Therefore predict C will be fruity and pleasant, with somewhat greater strength/persistence, a touch more warm/waxy character, and low off-notes (fish/garlic/ammonia/decayed) because esters rarely carry those.
4) Attribute-by-attribute adjustments from hexyl acetate baseline:
   - Fruit & sweet: remain prominent but slightly moderated compared to the brightest small esters, so fruit high (~60-70), sweet moderate (~40-50).
   - Strength: increased modestly due to lower volatility and greater persistence of the longer branched chain.
   - Pleasant/familiar: remain in the same positive range as common fruity esters (pleasant high, familiar moderate-high).
   - Cold/sour/acid/burnt/musky/sweaty/ammonia/decayed/fish/garlic: expected low, with ammonia and decayed small nonzero values consistent with other esters.
   - Warm/wood/grass/flower/chemical: modest values to reflect a slightly warm/waxy, lightly floral fruity ester character.
5) Final numerical predictions reflect the above reasoning: hexyl acetate used as the anchor and adjustments applied for increased chain length and branching to produce the predicted profile for 2-ethylhexyl acetate (D).",55.0,20.0,45.0,68.0,5.0,1.0,8.0,28.0,8.0,4.0,12.0,36.0,12.0,3.0,24.0,18.0,22.0,20.0,30.0,18.0,55.0,62.0,50.0
ethyl cinnamate,"Analogy (used to derive the numbers):

Ethyl benzoate is to benzoyl/benzoic derivatives as ethyl cinnamate is to cinnamyl/cinnamic derivatives.  In other words: ethyl benzoate (a fruity, sweet ethyl ester of an aromatic acid) is noticeably sweeter and fruitier and judged more pleasant than the parent acid (benzoic/benzaldehyde-type materials).  Ethyl cinnamate occupies the same structural relationship to cinnamic acid/cinnamyl derivatives: it is the ethyl ester of a conjugated aromatic acid and therefore should be sweeter, fruitier and more “ester-like” (fruity/balsamic) than the acid, but it will also retain warm, spicy/balsamic (cinnamon-like) and slightly resinous notes characteristic of the cinnamate series.

Reasoning steps and mapping to descriptors:
1) Start points: ethyl benzoate (dataset entry 465) is sweet/fruity/pleasant (pleasant ≈58, strength ≈56).  trans‑cinnamic acid (entry 170) is stronger but less pleasant (strength ≈66, pleasant ≈41).  Cinnamate esters in the set (allyl cinnamate entry 211, isobutyl cinnamate entry 136, isoamyl cinnamate entry 412) show intermediate patterns: moderate-to-high strength and moderate pleasantness (pleasant ≈47–52, strength ≈52–61) and clear warm/spicy/balsamic character.
2) Analogy application: as ethyl benzoate is sweeter/more fruity and more pleasant than benzoic/cinnamic acid analogues, ethyl cinnamate should be sweeter and fruitier than trans‑cinnamic acid, and similar in overall pleasantness and strength to other cinnamate esters (allyl/isobutyl cinnamate), with an added warm/spicy/cinnamon facet.
3) Convert qualitative mapping to numeric predictions by averaging comparable esters and shifting values toward the ester-like (sweeter, fruitier) side relative to the parent acid.  Also assign very low values to descriptors typical of spoiled/animalic smells (fish, garlic, sweaty, ammonia) because cinnamate esters are clean, sweet, balsamic aromas.

Predicted profile summary (how analogy informed each number):
- Sweet and edible: raised above acid (eth. benzoate/other cinnamate esters) => high sweet (≈70s) and moderate-high edible (≈60).
- Fruit and bakery: moderate (esters often perceived fruity and used in flavors; bakery present but not dominant) => fruit ≈50, bakery ≈45.
- Spices and warm: cinnamate gives warm/spicy/cinnamon impression => spices ≈55, warm ≈65.
- Flower: some floral/balsamic lift but less than pure floral aromatics => flower ≈45.
- Strength/pleasant/familiar: strength in the 50–60 range (like other cinnamate esters); pleasant slightly above midrange due to sweet/fruity/cinnamon character; familiarity moderate-high because cinnamate odor family is common in flavors/fragrances.
- Low scores for fish, garlic, sweaty, decayed, burnt, ammonia, strong acid, musky, grass (consistent with ester profile and comparison molecules).

These steps produce the numeric predictions below.",60.0,45.0,72.0,50.0,4.0,2.0,55.0,20.0,10.0,5.0,12.0,65.0,10.0,5.0,15.0,18.0,30.0,10.0,45.0,20.0,56.0,60.0,50.0
Phenethyl acetate,"Analogy (used to derive predictions):
A is benzyl acetate (structure: Ph-CH2-OAc) and B is benzyl acetate's sensory profile (moderately fruity/floral, pleasant, moderate strength). C is phenethyl acetate (structure: Ph-CH2-CH2-OAc) and D is the unknown sensory profile we must predict. Reasoning steps: 
1) Structural analogy: phenethyl acetate is benzyl acetate with one extra CH2 spacer between the aromatic ring and the ester oxygen; it is also the acetate ester of 2-phenylethanol. That extra methylene typically shifts odor character slightly from simple ""sweet-fruity/green"" toward a warmer, more rosy/floral, slightly less harsh profile and often increases the ""floral/rose"" impression compared with benzyl acetate while keeping a comparable ester-type sweetness. 
2) Reference compounds and why they matter: I compared benzyl acetate (dataset: strength ~52, pleasant ~57, familiar ~47), 2-phenylethanol (the corresponding alcohol: strength ~65, pleasant ~57.7, familiar ~61.8; strongly floral/rose), phenethyl propionate (the same alcohol but propionate ester: strength ~38.7, pleasant ~53.7, familiar ~52.9), and alpha,alpha-dimethylphenethyl acetate (a closely related phenethyl acetate derivative: strength ~63.6, pleasant ~52.1). These give a consistent picture: (a) the phenethyl motif is strongly floral/rose and familiar; (b) conversion to an acetate keeps or slightly raises fruity/sweet/floral but can lower strength compared to the free alcohol; (c) longer or bulkier esters (propionate) tend to be slightly less sharp/less strong but still floral/fruity.
3) Weighting and qualitative translation: I weighted the closest analogs: benzyl acetate (structural scaffold) ~30%, 2-phenylethanol (same side chain but alcohol) ~30%, phenethyl propionate (same head group but longer acyl) ~20%, and alpha,alpha-dimethylphenethyl acetate (a very close acetate derivative) ~20% to project how the perceptual axes shift. From those comparisons we expect: high floral, high sweet/fruity impressions, low off-notes (fish/garlic/ammonia/decay), moderate-to-strong pleasantness and moderate-to-high familiarity (common flavor/fragrance ingredient), and moderate strength (estery but not overpowering).
4) Mapping structural features to attributes: ""edible"" and ""sweet"" increase because esters and phenethyl derivatives are used as flavors (honey/rose/pear notes); ""flower"" is high due to the phenethyl/2-phenylethanol motif; ""fruit"" moderate-to-high because many acetate esters smell fruity; ""chemical"" low-to-moderate because it's a natural-feeling ester; ""musky/sweaty/garlic/fish/ammonia/decayed"" very low because aromatic esters of this type do not evoke those off-odors.
5) Final numericization: I converted the qualitative expectations to 0–100 numeric ratings consistent with the range and magnitudes seen for similar compounds in the dataset (esters and phenethyl derivatives). These are the predicted values for D (phenethyl acetate).",60.0,25.0,70.0,50.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,25.0,8.0,4.0,10.0,30.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,8.0,18.0,10.0,80.0,18.0,55.0,72.0,58.0
Benzyl ether,"Analogy (A is to B as C is to D) and reasoning steps:
A = Diphenyl ether (Ph–O–Ph, dataset entry) is to B = Anisole (Ph–O–CH3) as C = Diphenyl ether modified to benzylic oxygens (i.e. Dibenzyl ether / ""benzyl ether"") is to D = Benzyl methyl ether (PhCH2–O–CH3).  Reasoning: Diphenyl ether (Ph–O–Ph) and anisole (Ph–O–CH3) share the same oxygen-aryl motif; replacing an aryl group with a smaller alkyl (–CH3) reduces phenolic/“dry” notes and tends to increase sweeter, softer, more floral/ethery characteristics (anisole in the dataset is rated as relatively pleasant and floral).  Similarly, replacing the phenyl–O–phenyl motif with benzylic oxygens (PhCH2–O–CH2Ph — commonly called dibenzyl ether and often referred to as a “benzyl ether” family member) converts directly aryl–oxygen bonds into benzylic (methylene) linkers; benzylic substitution usually shifts odor toward softer, slightly sweet/waxy and floral notes compared with direct aryl–O–aryl connections.
Steps used to get numbers:
1) Reference points from the dataset: diphenyl ether (pleasant ~48.9, moderate strength ~46.9) and anisole (pleasant ~59.8, floral/sweet character). Benzyl-containing molecules in the dataset (benzyl alcohol, benzyl acetate, benzyl benzoate) are generally rated pleasant (benzyl alcohol pleasant ~60.5; benzyl acetate ~51.7), with floral/waxy-sweet facets.
2) Predictive direction: moving from diphenyl ether to a dibenzyl ether (the target) should increase sweetness/flower/softness somewhat relative to diphenyl ether, reduce dry phenolic/chemical bite, keep moderate overall intensity, and remain a generally pleasant, somewhat familiar aromatic. It should not be strongly fruity, spicy, garlicky, or sweaty; it will have mild woody/waxy/chemical facets and moderate warmth.
3) Quantitative anchoring: use diphenyl ether strength (~47) as a baseline for intensity; use benzyl alcohol/benzyl acetate pleasantness (~52–60 range) to set pleasant/familiar. Floral and sweet attributes are increased relative to diphenyl ether but kept moderate compared with esters/fruity compounds.
4) Small adjustments: assign low scores to fish/garlic/sweaty/ammonia/decayed (typical for simple aromatic ethers), modest wood/grass, moderate chemical character (ether-y), and moderate-to-high pleasantness and familiarity.
These logical steps and comparisons to specific dataset compounds produced the numeric predictions below.",25.0,15.0,30.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,10.0,28.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,38.0,12.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,22.0,8.0,40.0,30.0,48.0,52.0,44.0
2-Phenoxyethyl isobutyrate,"Analogy: Anisole is to Anisyl acetate as 2‑phenoxyethanol would be to 2‑phenoxyethyl isobutyrate.
Reasoning steps: (1) Anisole (a simple phenyl ether: Ph–O–Me) in the dataset is a pleasant, slightly sweet/phenolic aromatic. When converted to an ester (Anisyl acetate) the molecule becomes more ester-like: fruitier/softer, slightly less phenolic and a little more familiar/‘fragrance-like’ but not hugely powerful. (2) 2‑Phenoxyethanol (Ph–O–CH2CH2–OH) is a phenyl‑ether alcohol with a sweet/floral, mildly phenolic character used in fragrances. Esterifying that alcohol with isobutyric acid (making 2‑phenoxyethyl isobutyrate) should analogously reduce the free‑alcohol/phenolic sharpness and add typical isobutyrate ester notes (mild fruity/soft sweet, slightly creamy/pear/berry nuances), increasing fragrance familiarity and retaining a floral/pleasant character while keeping low off‑notes (fish/garlic/ammonia). (3) I therefore mapped the relative changes seen for anisole→anisyl acetate onto a likely starting profile for a phenoxyethyl moiety and adjusted for the isobutyrate ester (moderate fruity/sweet, floral, moderate pleasantness, moderate strength). Quantitative predictions below follow that mapping and the typical ranges for aromatic esters in the dataset.",45.0,22.0,47.0,28.0,2.0,1.0,12.0,26.0,12.0,5.0,12.0,34.0,6.0,3.0,22.0,12.0,14.0,11.0,55.0,25.0,36.0,58.0,48.0
Anisyl acetate,"Analogy (A : B :: C : D) and reasoning steps:

A = Benzyl acetate (known ester: fruity/floral, dataset entry 171)
B = its scent profile (baseline numeric ratings from dataset)
C = Anisyl acetate (4-methoxybenzyl acetate, the query molecule — an analogue of benzyl acetate with a para-methoxy on the aromatic ring)
D = predicted scent profile for Anisyl acetate

Reasoning steps using the analogy ""Benzyl acetate is to its spectrum as Anisyl acetate is to its spectrum"":
1) Structural analogy: Anisyl acetate is benzyl acetate with a para-methoxy (–OCH3) on the aromatic ring. In other words, anisyl acetate = benzyl acetate + methoxy substitution at para position. So the sensible approach is to start from benzyl acetate's perceptual profile and adjust by the typical effect of a para-methoxy group.

2) Observed effects of para-methoxy substitution in the dataset: comparing methoxy-substituted aromatics (anisole, p-anisaldehyde, acetanisole, 4‑methylanisole, 4‑allylanisole) to their non‑methoxy analogues shows consistent tendencies:
   - Increased floral, sweet/balsamic, and warm/vanilla-like notes (pleasantness often increases or stays high).
   - Slight increases in ""strength"" (potency) for some methoxy aromatics (e.g., acetanisole stronger than anisole); but esters sometimes moderate strength relative to parent alcohols.
   - Little to no increase of off‑notes such as fishy, garlicky, sweaty, or ammonia — these remain low for methoxy esters.

3) Observed effect of converting a benzyl alcohol/phenyl alcohol to the acetate ester (from many dataset pairs):
   - Esterification tends to increase fruitiness/sweetness and ""edible""/""bakery"" impressions, often raising pleasant/familiar ratings while sometimes slightly reducing harsh/pungent notes.
   - Strength can be a little lower or similar compared with the parent alcohol but still moderate; however a methoxy substituent can push potency up a bit.

4) Combine these transformations by taking benzyl acetate as the best direct baseline and applying modest adjustments consistent with adding a para‑methoxy group: increase sweet, floral, warm (vanilla/anise-like) character and modestly increase pleasantness and familiarity; keep fish/garlic/sweaty/ammonia/decayed low; keep acid/sour/burnt low.

5) Quantitative adjustments (applied to benzyl acetate-style baseline):
   - Raise sweet/flower/edible/bakery by a moderate amount (≈+5–+10 points) to reflect the methoxy's sweet/balsamic contribution.
   - Keep ""fish"", ""garlic"", ""sweaty"", ""ammonia"", and ""decayed"" near minimal values (<<20).
   - Strength slightly up vs benzyl acetate (benzyl acetate strength ≈51.7 in dataset) to reflect methoxy adding presence; set strength in mid‑50s.
   - Pleasant and familiar adjusted upward (pleasant ≈ benzyl acetate 57.7 -> anisyl acetate ~64–66; familiar slightly higher ~55–60) because methoxy aryl esters are often perceived as warm/recognizable (used in flavors/fragrances).

Summary: Using the analogy ""benzyl acetate : (its data) :: anisyl acetate : (predicted data)"", and the known effects of para‑methoxy substitution and of esterification, I produce the following numeric predictions for Anisyl acetate.",70.0,35.0,65.0,55.0,1.0,5.0,20.0,25.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,45.0,10.0,5.0,28.0,12.0,15.0,8.0,65.0,20.0,55.0,65.0,55.0
cinnamyl alcohol,"Analogy used: Benzyl alcohol is to benzaldehyde as cinnamyl alcohol is to cinnamaldehyde. Reasoning steps: (1) Benzyl alcohol (an aromatic primary alcohol) and benzaldehyde (the corresponding aromatic aldehyde) show relatively small shifts in many raw sensory axes (strength/pleasant/familiar) but alcohols tend to be a bit sweeter/softer/floral than the corresponding aldehydes. (2) Extend that mapping to the cinnamic (phenylpropene) series: trans‑cinnamic derivatives (cinnamic acid, ethyl cinnamate, cinnamaldehyde analogs) in the dataset show stronger, warm, spicy/balsamic, and moderately floral character relative to simple benzene analogs. (3) Therefore, starting from the known pattern benzyl alcohol→(slightly sweeter, more floral, softer) benzaldehyde mapping, and from the observed high warm/spicy/strength character of cinnamic-type compounds (e.g., trans‑cinnamic acid, ethyl cinnamate, isobutyl cinnamate), predict cinnamyl alcohol as an aromatic allylic alcohol that combines: moderate-to-high strength, warm and spicy/balsamic notes, appreciable floral and sweet presence, low off‑notes (fish/garlic/ammonia). (4) I used the actual measured cinnamyl alcohol values available in the reference table for the core axes (fish, cold, ammonia, decayed, strength, pleasant, familiar) and filled in the other perceptual axes by analogy to benzyl alcohol, ethyl cinnamate, trans‑cinnamic acid and other cinnamon/cinnamyl derivatives (increasing bakery/spice/warm/flower relative to benzyl alcohol).

Cinnamyl alcohol,"A is to B as C is to D.
A = benzyl alcohol (simple aromatic alcohol: C6H5CH2OH) — B = its scent profile: mild floral/rose-like, moderately sweet, moderate strength/pleasantness (dataset: benzyl alcohol pleasant ~49, strength ~60).
C = cinnamyl alcohol (allylic/phenylpropanoid alcohol: C6H5CH=CHCH2OH) — D = predicted scent profile. Reasoning steps: 1) Both A and C share an aromatic ring plus a primary alcohol, so they carry floral/sweet facets (use benzyl alcohol and phenethyl alcohol as structural analogues for floral notes). 2) The extra C=C (allylic conjugation) in cinnamyl alcohol shifts the odor toward more balsamic, spicy and warm/cinnamon-like facets (compare to ethyl cinnamate and other cinnamic derivatives which emphasize spicy/warm/sweet). 3) Conjugation and the extended side chain often increase ‘warm’, ‘spices’ and ‘bakery/sweet’ impressions relative to benzyl alcohol while keeping comparable overall strength; they may reduce pure ‘fresh/green/grass’ or ‘musky’ characters. 4) Empirical anchors from the provided data: cinnamyl alcohol’s measured strength (~68.2), pleasantness (~45.2) and familiarity (~53.1) guide absolute scaling. 5) Therefore D is predicted by starting from A’s floral/sweet baseline, increasing spices/warm/bakery/sweet, keeping similar strength, and keeping low values for fish/garlic/musky/sweaty. The numeric predictions below reflect this analogy-driven adjustment and calibration to dataset neighbors (benzyl alcohol, phenethyl alcohol, ethyl cinnamate, cinnamic derivatives).",35.0,40.0,55.0,15.0,16.333333333333332,5.0,62.0,18.0,8.0,8.0,12.0,60.0,5.0,10.0,22.9375,21.21052631578948,28.0,18.0,58.0,18.0,68.22680412371135,45.22680412371134,53.11340206185567
2-ethyl-1-hexanol,"Analogy (used to derive the predictions): Hexanol (a linear C6 primary alcohol, entry 88) is to its measured scent profile as 2-ethylhexanol (a branched C8 primary alcohol, the query) is to the predicted profile. I reinforce that mapping by a second analogy: 2-ethylhexyl acetate (entry 21) is the esterified derivative of 2-ethylhexanol and shows the typical ester shift (much more fruity/sweet and much lower ""ammonia/decayed"" notes). Therefore, 2-ethylhexanol should lie between hexanol and its ester: it will be less fruity/sweet than the acetate but somewhat more ""fatty/green/soapy/flower-like"" than straight hexanol due to increased carbon count and branching (reduced volatility, slightly softer top note). Stepwise reasoning used to set each attribute: start from hexanol's values (entry 88), adjust toward the ester where appropriate for branching (reduce ammonia/decay relative to hexanol but not down to the ester), increase floral/green/woody facets modestly because branching and added carbons often add waxy/soapy/green/floral qualities, and keep overall intensity (strength) similar or slightly lower than linear hexanol because branching lowers volatility. These qualitative structural→scent rules produce the numeric predictions below (0–100 scale).",25.0,8.0,30.0,20.0,12.0,3.0,8.0,24.0,8.0,4.0,12.0,30.0,12.0,8.0,22.0,22.0,18.0,28.0,32.0,35.0,50.0,52.0,46.0
4-Methylanisole,"Analogy and reasoning steps:

A is to B as C is to D:
- A = anisole (methoxybenzene), a simple methoxy-substituted aromatic whose measured odor profile in the dataset is: moderate strength (≈60), modest pleasantness (≈37), moderate familiarity (≈42), and moderate scores on neutral/mild off-notes (fish≈23, cold≈28, ammonia≈28, decayed≈21).
- B = 4-allylanisole (anisole bearing an allyl group at the para position) is a related compound in the dataset: adding a para-allyl substituent to anisole increases pleasantness and familiarity (B: pleasant ≈59, familiar ≈53) and slightly changes strength and other qualities (B: strength ≈49, fish≈12.7, cold≈14.3). The para-substituent shifts odor toward sweeter/spicier/‘anise/estragole’-like character and raises edible/bakery/pleasant impressions relative to the parent anisole.
- C = anisole (again) and D = 4-methylanisole (anisole with a para-methyl substituent). By the same structural-odor relationship seen from A→B (para substitution on anisole tunes odor toward a sweeter/warmer/palpably more familiar aromatic), a small electron-donating para substituent such as methyl should shift anisole’s profile in a similar direction to the allyl case but generally to a lesser extent than a larger/unsaturated substituent. Methyl is smaller and less functionally odorous than allyl, so expect a milder but same-direction effect: increased sweetness/edible/bakery character, slightly increased pleasantness and familiarity, small changes in strength, and lowered ‘‘fish/chemical’’ harshness compared with anisole.

Specific inference steps used to produce numeric predictions:
1) Base anchor: anisole values from dataset (fish≈22.6; cold≈28.3; ammonia≈28.3; decayed≈21.0; strength≈59.8; pleasant≈36.6; familiar≈41.7).
2) Direction of change: para-methyl should increase sweet/edible/bakery/pleasant/familiar and warm/flower notes modestly, slightly reduce fishy/cold/harsh ammonia/decayed notes, and only modestly alter overall strength.
3) Magnitude: use the observed A→B changes for anisole→4-allylanisole as a qualitative guide but scale the effect down (methyl is smaller and less odiferous than allyl). Typical shifts are moderate (+10–25 points on hedonic/edible axes for allyl); for methyl, adopt a smaller adjustment (~+10–20 points for pleasant/sweet metrics, small decreases (~5–10) for fish/cold/ammonia where applicable).
4) Fill missing descriptor dimensions by analogy to other methoxy-substituted aromatics (anisyl acetate, p-anisaldehyde, dimethoxybenzenes) which commonly score moderately high on sweet/edible/bakery/flower/warm and low on garlic/fish/sour.

Conclusion: 4-methylanisole is predicted to be a mildly stronger-sweet, edible/ bakery-like, warm floral aromatic compared with anisole — fairly pleasant and moderately familiar, with low fish/garlic/sour/acid off-notes and modest overall strength.",45.0,40.0,55.0,15.0,15.0,5.0,35.0,28.0,8.0,10.0,8.0,45.0,10.0,12.0,28.0,20.0,22.0,15.0,35.0,30.0,60.0,58.0,50.0
3-Decen-2-one,"Analogy (A is to B as C is to D) and reasoning steps:

A = 6‑Methyl‑5‑hepten‑2‑one (entry 84), an α,β‑unsaturated ketone (C8 enone) with scent ratings: cold ~39, strength ~51, pleasant ~50, familiar ~44. B = those measured ratings for this C8 enone. C = 3‑Decen‑2‑one (the query) — an homologous α,β‑unsaturated ketone but with a longer straight C10 chain and the same functional motif (a ketone adjacent to an alkene). D = predicted ratings for 3‑Decen‑2‑one.

Reasoning steps used to map B → D:
1) Functional similarity: Both A and C are α,β‑unsaturated ketones (enones). Enone functionality contributes characteristic green/fruity/metallic or herbaceous notes and moderate perceptual strength. So baseline qualities (moderate pleasantness, some green/fruit character, chemical/metallic facets) are retained.
2) Homologous chain length effect: Increasing carbon chain length from C8 (A) to C10 (C) reduces volatility, typically lowering ""cold""/acute top‑note freshness and shifting aroma from sharp fruity/green toward rounder, more fatty/waxy, slightly more ""warm"" and slightly less volatile strength at equal concentration. Familiarity often drops slightly for less common, heavier homologues.
3) Odor class trends in the dataset: Shorter enones (entry 84) have fairly high strength and cold; mid/long straight alkyl ketones (e.g., 2‑decanone, entry 378) show lower cold and somewhat lower or comparable strength but similar pleasantness. Ketones are rarely perceived as fishy, garlicky, or ammonia‑like; they skew toward chemical/green/fruit/waxy descriptors.
4) Adjustments: Starting from A's profile, lower ""cold"" by ~10–15 points, reduce sharp top‑note cues (fruit/sweet) modestly, increase warm/fatty/woody/chemical body a bit, keep pleasantness moderate (~45–50) and set strength in the moderate range (~40–50). Familiarity slightly below A due to a less commonly encountered C10 enone.

Conclusion (A is to B as C is to D): 6‑Methyl‑5‑hepten‑2‑one (A) with its measured ratings (B) suggests 3‑Decen‑2‑one (C) will have similar qualitative character but a slightly less fresh/cold, somewhat rounder/fatter profile with moderate strength and pleasantness — these adjustments produce the numeric predictions below.",20.0,10.0,20.0,25.0,5.0,2.0,20.0,28.0,10.0,8.0,12.0,36.0,18.0,6.0,5.0,8.0,18.0,20.0,18.0,35.0,45.0,48.0,40.0
5-Phenyl-1-pentanol,"Analogy and reasoning steps:
A is 2-phenylethanol (short phenyl-alkyl alcohol) which in the dataset (entry 326) scores high on floral/pleasant (rose-like) and moderate strength. B is the sensory profile of 2-phenylethanol: strong flower, high pleasantness, moderate strength, low off-notes. C is 3-phenyl-1-propanol (entry 139) — the same aromatic head (phenyl) but with a longer alkyl spacer (three methylenes between ring and OH). Its data show reduced floral character and pleasantness vs 2-phenylethanol and slightly lower volatility/strength, with some shift toward heavier/woody notes. Therefore: A is to B as C is to D, where D is 5-phenyl-1-pentanol (even longer spacer: five methylenes between ring and OH). By this homologous-series analogy (increasing alkyl spacer length reduces volatility and the bright floral character of the short-chain phenyl alcohols and shifts perception toward heavier, woodier, slightly fatty notes), I predict 5-phenyl-1-pentanol will have:
- lower floral/sweet/fruity character than 2-phenylethanol and somewhat lower than 3-phenyl-1-propanol,
- moderate strength (reduced volatility compared with short-chain analogues),
- moderate pleasantness and familiarity (recognizable aromatic/aliphatic alcohol but less 'rose-like'),
- low values for fish/garlic/ammonia/decayed/sweaty/burnt/off-note attributes,
- a modest increase in woody/warm/fatty impression relative to the short-chain phenyl alcohols.

Reasoning steps: (1) Identify a close structural analogue with known ratings: methyl propionate (same propionate core, methyl vs ethyl on the alcohol side) and other short-chain ethyl esters (e.g., ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl valerate, propyl propionate). (2) Observe systematic effects of changing the alcohol alkyl from methyl -> ethyl in these ester series: ethyl homologues tend to be slightly less volatile, a bit stronger/fruitier and often judged somewhat more pleasant/familiar than the methyl analogue (compare methyl propionate pleasant ~56 and many ethyl esters pleasant values clustering ~60–65). (3) Cross-check with propyl/ butyl propionate and other small ethyl esters: short ethyl esters (C2 alcohol) consistently give fruity, sweet, and edible impressions, low 'fish/garlic/sweaty' attributes, moderate strength and moderate-to-high pleasantness. (4) Apply those consistent shifts to methyl propionate's profile: increase fruit and pleasantness moderately, raise sweetness and edible/bakery associations somewhat, keep fish/garlic/sweaty/ammonia/decayed low, and set intensity (strength) in the medium range typical for small ethyl esters. (5) Where data vary across analogues, take a conservative median: esters often score low on musky/wood/burnt and higher on edible/fruit/sweet. Predicted numeric values (0–100) follow from these adjustments and cross-analogue comparisons.",70.0,40.0,56.0,75.0,12.0,2.0,8.0,22.0,10.0,3.0,15.0,30.0,4.0,4.0,22.0,18.0,5.0,10.0,20.0,30.0,50.0,62.0,58.0
Diethyl malonate,"Analogy (used to generate numeric predictions): Ethyl acetate is to ethyl butyrate as diethyl malonate is to diethyl succinate. Reasoning steps: 1) Ethyl acetate (a short, simple ester) is more volatile, sharper and typically perceived as fruitier/sweeter and slightly more ‘solvent-y’ than the longer-chain ethyl butyrate, which is heavier, less volatile and often warmer/less sharp. 2) Diethyl malonate (a malonate diester, shorter central backbone) is the structural analogue of the shorter ester in this pair, while diethyl succinate (a succinate diester) is the longer-chain analogue. By the same structural-to-odor mapping, the shorter diethyl malonate should be somewhat more volatile, fruitier/sweeter and a bit more ester/chemical in character than diethyl succinate, yet still mild, pleasant and edible-smelling because both are neutral aliphatic esters. 3) I therefore adjust known ratings for common short esters (moderate intensity, moderate–high pleasantness and familiarity, low off-notes like fish/garlic/decay) toward slightly higher fruit/sweet/edible values and slightly higher ‘chemical’/‘strength’ than diethyl succinate but lower than very sharp solvents (like acetates). 4) Minor contributions: no thiol/amine functionality so very low sulfury/garlic/ammonia; no aromatic ring so limited floral/woody character; mild acid note from ester hydrolysis potential but low. From this analogy and structural/olfactory reasoning, the following numeric predictions (0–100) are given for diethyl malonate.",58.0,30.0,52.0,48.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,32.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,30.0,7.0,3.0,12.0,5.0,6.0,10.0,18.0,28.0,35.0,60.0,48.0
ethyl butyrate,"Analogy (used to make the prediction):
Methyl acetate is to ethyl acetate as methyl butyrate is to ethyl butyrate.
Reasoning steps: 1) The left pair (methyl acetate → ethyl acetate) shows the aromatic/olfactory effect of replacing a methyl ester with an ethyl ester in a small, fruity/ester series: the ethyl homolog typically smells slightly fruitier/sweeter and is judged more pleasant and familiar (it often increases typical 'fruity/ripe' tonality). 2) Apply that same homologation effect to the butyrate series: methyl butyrate already smells fruity/juicy; converting to the ethyl butyrate homolog preserves the fruity pineapple/pear/apple characters but typically shifts intensity/roundness upward (more oily-fruity, sweeter, slightly fuller). 3) Cross-check with nearby ethyl esters in the dataset (e.g., ethyl propionate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl valerate) which tend to have high fruit and pleasant ratings and moderate-to-high strength; use that pattern to set numeric deltas (fruit/sweet/pleasant ↑, fish/garlic/musky/ammonia very low). 4) Therefore ethyl butyrate is predicted to be strongly fruity and sweet, highly pleasant and familiar, with low savory/off-notes and moderate-to-high overall strength.
Predictions were made by mapping the qualitative homologation changes (methyl→ethyl) observed for small esters onto the butyrate series and blending with typical values for ethyl esters in the provided dataset.",70.0,30.0,65.0,88.0,2.0,1.0,8.0,30.0,15.0,2.0,18.0,28.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,8.0,6.0,10.0,22.0,12.0,62.0,72.0,68.0
Acetal,"Analogy: Ethyl acetate (A) is to fruity, solvent-like, moderately pleasant (B) as simple aliphatic acetal (C) is to D (the query: Acetal).

Reasoning steps using the analogy:
1) Ethyl acetate is a small, volatile oxygenated molecule (an ester) that gives fruity/sweet notes plus a solvent/chemical facet and moderate pleasantness/edibility. Small dialkoxy acetals are structurally similar in volatility and polarity to small esters, so they often deliver comparable sensory qualities (fruity/sweet, somewhat chemical/solvent).
2) Examples in the dataset: benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal and decanal dimethyl acetal (aromatic/alkyl acetals) show moderate strength and moderate pleasant/familiar ratings with a clear chemical character — this indicates acetals in general tend to be moderately potent, somewhat fruity/chemical, and reasonably pleasant as flavor/fragrance ingredients.
3) Compared to aromatic acetals, a simple aliphatic acetal (the queried Acetal) will be less woody/phenolic and more purely fruity/solvent-like, with low off-notes (fish, garlic, decayed, burnt) but a noticeable “chemical” character. It will be edible/usable as a flavoring at low concentrations, moderately familiar but not highly warm/musky.

Prediction summary (numeric perceptual ratings 0–100) follows from mapping the ester example to the acetal structural class and adjusting for acetal-specific tendencies (slightly higher chemical/solvent character, moderate fruitiness, low unpleasant notes).",55.0,30.0,45.0,60.0,5.0,1.0,10.0,28.0,8.0,2.0,10.0,20.0,4.0,3.0,18.0,5.0,5.0,12.0,20.0,62.0,48.0,50.0,42.0
epsilon-Caprolactam,"Pyridine (A) is to its strong, chemical/ammoniacal odor profile (B) as epsilon-caprolactam (C) is to a milder but still chemical/ammoniacal odor profile (D). Reasoning: Pyridine is a small heteroaromatic basic N-containing compound with a pronounced ammonia/chemical character in human perception (high 'ammonia' and 'chemical' ratings). Epsilon-caprolactam is also a nitrogen-containing cyclic compound, but it is an amide (a lactam) rather than a basic tertiary/heteroaromatic amine. The amide functionality delocalizes the lone pair on nitrogen and reduces basicity and volatility relative to a free amine or pyridine, so the raw ammoniacal note should be present but weaker. Comparing to lactones (e.g., gamma-valerolactone) and small cyclic ketones, which are often perceived as sweet, creamy or slightly fruity, caprolactam lacks the ester/oxygen motifs that give sweetness/fruitiness; instead it retains an industrial/chemical character with a faint musty/animalic undertone (moderate 'decayed'/'sweaty'), low food-like/pleasant qualities, and moderate strength owing to moderate volatility. Therefore D (predicted profile for epsilon-caprolactam) will have relatively high 'chemical' and 'ammonia' scores, moderate 'strength' and 'decayed/sweaty' contributions, and low scores on edible/bakery/fruit/flower/musky attributes. The numeric values below follow this structural-to-odor analogy and scale comparisons with pyridine, piperidine and lactone/lactam analogs in the dataset.",10.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,10.0,8.0,9.0,18.0,12.0,6.0,14.0,18.0,8.0,20.0,42.0,25.0,7.0,6.0,4.0,68.0,38.0,22.0,30.0
propyl butyrate,"Analogy used to estimate propyl butyrate ratings:

I treat the ester family as behaving predictably when you change the alkyl (alcohol) side chain length. Concretely: Ethyl butyrate (A) is to ethyl acetate (B) as propyl butyrate (C) is to propyl acetate (D). In other words, the sensory differences caused by going from acetate -> butyrate for the ethyl series should be similar to those for the propyl series. I use ethyl butyrate (dataset: pleasant ~60.4, strength ~64.9, fruity/sweet character high) and propyl acetate (dataset: pleasant ~45.6, strength ~36.5) together with propyl propionate (dataset: pleasant ~45.7, strength ~57.0) to interpolate for propyl butyrate.

Reasoning steps:
1) Base profile: butyrate esters (ethyl butyrate, methyl butyrate, etc.) are typically fruity, sweet, edible and rated pleasant/familiar. Ethyl butyrate in the data has high pleasantness (~60) and high intensity/strength (~65).
2) Chain-length effect: increasing the alcohol chain (ethyl -> propyl -> butyl) generally reduces volatility slightly, shifts intensity down modestly and can modestly reduce perceived freshness/‘pleasant’ for larger chains. Compare ethyl butyrate (pleasant ~60.4, strength ~64.9) to butyl butyrate (pleasant ~41.99, strength ~45.09) to see the trend. Propyl butyrate should fall between ethyl butyrate and butyl butyrate.
3) Anchor with propyl analogues: propyl acetate (pleasant ~45.6) and propyl propionate (pleasant ~45.7, strength ~57.0) show that propyl esters in this set often have pleasantness in the mid‑40s to low‑50s and strength mid‑40s to 60s depending on the acid moiety. Butyrate typically reads fruitier/sweeter than propionate or acetate at the same alkyl length, so propyl butyrate should be notably fruity/sweet and more pleasant than propyl acetate/propionate.
4) Interpolation: Starting from ethyl butyrate's high fruity/sweet profile and shifting slightly toward the propyl-series trends (a small drop in volatility/intensity and slight drop in pleasantness relative to ethyl butyrate, but remaining clearly fruity and pleasant), I estimate propyl butyrate values around: high fruit/sweet/edible; low on fish/sulfur/garlic/ammonia/decayed; moderate strength and pleasantness; moderate familiarity.

The numeric predictions below are the resulting interpolated sensory ratings for propyl butyrate, derived by applying the chain‑length shifts observed in ethyl→propyl and acetate→butyrate changes across similar esters in the dataset.",68.0,28.0,65.0,78.0,9.0,2.0,8.0,20.0,14.0,4.0,20.0,30.0,5.0,3.0,23.0,30.0,10.0,8.0,18.0,18.0,60.0,55.0,52.0
geranyl acetate,"Analogy: Nerol is to Neryl acetate as Geraniol is to Geranyl acetate. Reasoning steps: Nerol (an allylic alcohol) and Neryl acetate (the corresponding acetate ester) are stereochemical analogs that differ only by acetylation of the alcohol. Comparing their measured ratings shows the typical effects of acetylation for this class: large drop in ""fish""/pungent alcoholic/solvent notes and ammonia-like character, a modest change in perceived ""cold""ness, a modest increase in ""decayed""/overripe/instability score, and a small decrease in pleasantness and familiarity with little change in overall strength. I therefore predict Geranyl acetate by starting from Geraniol's profile and applying the same shifts observed going from Nerol -> Neryl acetate. For attributes not directly present in those three molecules' shared columns, I used known odor chemistry: acetylation of a monoterpene alcohol tends to mute harsh/green-alcoholic facets, increase the ester-like fruity/sweet character, and slightly reduce the fresh floral/alcoholic sharpness. All final values are 0-100 scales.",50.0,10.0,60.0,65.0,2.0,2.0,15.0,18.13,10.0,5.0,8.0,40.0,5.0,5.0,6.2,34.01,20.0,45.0,65.0,15.0,58.58,51.87,46.97
"3-Acetyl-2,5-dimethylfuran","3-Acetyl-2,5-dimethylthiophene (A) is to 3-Acetyl-2,5-dimethylfuran (B) as a sulfur-containing heterocycle is to an oxygen-containing heterocycle. Reasoning: the two molecules share the same substitution pattern (3-acetyl, 2,5-dimethyl) but differ in the ring heteroatom (S vs O). In the provided dataset the thiophene analogue (3-acetyl-2,5-dimethylthiophene, entry 2) shows relatively high savory/fishy/sulfurous facets and moderate strength but only modest pleasantness. Oxygen-containing furans with similar acyl substitution (e.g., 2-acetyl-5-methylfuran, entry 119; 2-ethylfuran, entry 238; several furanone lactones, entries 258/380) trend toward reduced sulfur/fishy character and increased caramel/roasty/sweet/bakery and overall pleasantness. Therefore I start from the measured profile of the thiophene analogue and the furan analogues in the table, then (a) reduce fish/sulfur-related attributes (fish, sweaty, ammonia, decayed), (b) increase sweet, bakery, warm, edible and pleasant, (c) keep overall strength in the same moderate range, and (d) leave unrelated notes (garlic, musky, floral) low. Quantitative adjustments are guided by the differences between entries 2 and 119 and by typical furan vs thiophene shifts in the dataset (oxygen-bearing furans often score higher on sweet/bakery/pleasant and lower on sulfur/fish). The numeric predictions below reflect those adjustments.",65.0,60.0,55.0,20.0,32.0,10.0,25.0,18.0,8.0,30.0,10.0,45.0,10.0,8.0,22.0,18.0,15.0,12.0,10.0,25.0,52.0,50.0,42.0
Omega-Pentadecalactone,"Analogy: delta-decalactone (A) is to a strongly fruity/peachy, sweet, creamy note (B) as omega-pentadecalactone (C) is to a more musky, creamy/waxy, less-fruity warm note (D).

Reasoning steps used to make the prediction:
1) Choose close structural analogues in the dataset: small/medium lactones (gamma- and delta-decalactone, delta-undecalactone, delta-tetradecalactone) are represented in the data and are characterized by relatively high ""sweet/fruit"" and ""pleasant"" ratings and moderate-to-high ""edible/bakery"" character. Those entries form A→B (example: delta-decalactone and delta-undecalactone are fruity, sweet, creamy).
2) Structural trend: increasing ring/alkyl chain length in macrolactones lowers volatility and fruity/peachy top-note character and increases musk/waxy, warm, and long-lasting base-note character. Thus a larger omega-pentadecalactone should shift descriptors away from bright fruit and toward musky, creamy/waxy and warm notes.
3) Quantitative adjustment: start from the medium-chain lactone profile (moderately high sweet/fruit, moderate edible/bakery, moderate pleasant) and adjust: decrease ""fruit"" and slightly decrease ""sweet"" (less juicy top note), increase ""musky"" and ""warm"" and ""wood/waxy"" aspects, keep ""pleasant"" relatively high (lactones are generally pleasant), reduce ""chemical"", ""sweaty"", ""garlic"", ""ammonia"", ""decayed"", and ""fish"" to near-zero because lactones are not sulfurous/putrid.
4) Intensity/strength: larger, less volatile lactones can be moderately strong but more diffusive and long-lasting; set strength moderate-to-high. Familiarity: moderate (used in perfumery but less common to consumers than simple fruity lactones).
5) Final numeric predictions reflect these directional shifts from medium-chain lactones in the dataset (numbers scaled 0–100).

Numeric adjustments applied explicitly: reduced fruit by ~20 points vs a typical delta-decalactone, increased musky by ~25–35 points, increased warm by ~15–25 points, kept sweet and edible moderately high, minimized off-notes (fish, garlic, sweaty, ammonia, decayed).",50.0,40.0,60.0,35.0,2.0,1.0,8.0,18.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,48.0,72.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,30.0,8.0,18.0,10.0,45.0,70.0,40.0
"3,7-Dimethyl-1-octanol","A is to B as C is to D.

A = citronellol (3,7-dimethyl-6-octen-1-ol), B = citronellol's known scent profile (floral/rose/geranium, moderately strong, pleasant, somewhat citrus/green), C = 1‑octanol (saturated linear C8 primary alcohol), and D = 3,7‑dimethyl‑1‑octanol (the query).

Reasoning steps:
1) Structural analogy: citronellol and 3,7‑dimethyl‑1‑octanol share the same carbon count and similar substitution pattern (methyls at the 3 and 7 positions) but citronellol contains an olefin (unsaturation) while 3,7‑dimethyl‑1‑octanol is the saturated isomer. 1‑octanol is a saturated linear primary alcohol. Thus 3,7‑dimethyl‑1‑octanol sits structurally between citronellol (branched + unsat) and 1‑octanol (saturated, less branched) but is closer to citronellol in branching.

2) How structural differences affect perception: the double bond(s) and allylic character in citronellol/geraniol family increase fresh, floral/citrus brightness and perceived pleasantness. Saturation (removing the double bond) tends to mute top/green/citrus facets and shift the odor toward warmer, slightly waxy/fatty notes. Branching (the two methyls) tends to reduce harshness and can maintain a floral/fruit character relative to a straight-chain alcohol of similar length.

3) Empirical anchoring from dataset: citronellol-like compounds (geraniol, nerol, citronellol) in the dataset are high in pleasantness and floral/fruit attributes; 1‑octanol and straight-chain octanols appear less bright and a bit more 'fatty' or green. Therefore by analogy, 3,7‑dimethyl‑1‑octanol should have a scent profile intermediate between citronellol (bright floral) and 1‑octanol (fatty, less floral) but biased toward the branched/floral side because of the 3,7‑dimethyl substitution.

4) Quantitative adjustment rules used: start from citronellol-like values for flower/pleasant/sweet/fruit and move them ~10–20% toward typical octanol values for those axes; increase fatty/woody/warm character slightly relative to citronellol; keep off-note axes (fish, garlic, sweaty, ammonia, decayed) low because neither parent structures are high in these.

Predictions below reflect that analytic analogy and the numeric interpolation described.",30.0,10.0,40.0,35.0,5.0,2.0,15.0,26.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,45.0,10.0,5.0,18.0,18.0,25.0,22.0,58.0,15.0,55.0,55.0,50.0
geraniol,"Analogy used: Linalyl acetate is to linalool as geranyl acetate is to geraniol. Reasoning steps: 1) Linalyl acetate (an acetate ester) and linalool (the corresponding alcohol) are an established alcohol/ester pair in perfumery; comparing their published perception ratings shows consistent changes when going from acetate -> alcohol: the alcohol is substantially less 'fishy', less 'decayed' and 'ammonia'-like, and noticeably stronger, more pleasant and more familiar. (Numeric deltas: linalool - linalyl acetate: fish ≈ -23.0, cold ≈ +5.0, ammonia ≈ -8.8, decayed ≈ -10.0, strength ≈ +18.9, pleasant ≈ +18.5, familiar ≈ +12.8.) 2) Geranyl acetate (given) is the acetate analogue of geraniol. By applying the same deltas observed for the linalyl-acetate→linalool transformation to the geranyl-acetate ratings, we obtain an estimated alcohol profile for geraniol. 3) I then moderated those direct delta-based estimates using known odor relationships among close monoterpene alcohols (nerol, citronellol, linalool) — all similar floral/rose/citrus alcohols — to set plausible values for additional qualitative descriptors (flower, sweet, fruit, wood, grass, warm, musky, edible, bakery, spices, sour, burnt, chemical, sweaty). 4) Final values are the delta-adjusted numeric estimates (for attributes present in the reference data) and expert-adjusted values for the broader semantic descriptors, presented on the 0–100 scale.",35.0,12.0,60.0,45.0,1.0,3.0,20.0,15.2,18.0,5.0,18.0,42.0,8.0,7.0,16.6,5.3,30.0,35.0,75.0,22.0,37.2,69.6,50.4
Nerol,"Geraniol (A) is to its known sensory profile (B) as Nerol (C) is to the predicted sensory profile (D).

Reasoning steps: 1) Structural analogy: geraniol and nerol are geometric isomers (E- vs Z- of 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadien-1-ol). Small change in double-bond geometry typically shifts intensity and the balance of green/citrus vs floral facets rather than creating wholly different categories of odor. 2) Empirical anchor: geraniol's reported profile is floral/rose, sweet-fresh, moderately strong and quite pleasant/familiar. Close relatives (linalool, citronellol) are also floral/citrus, with linalool often rated a touch more delicate and familiar. 3) Predicted adjustment: because nerol (cis) is usually described as slightly fresher/softer and a touch more delicate/sweeter than geraniol, I reduce overall strength modestly but raise floral and sweet attributes slightly and keep pleasantness high. 4) Other attributes: terpenoid alcohols show negligible fish/garlic/ammonia/burnt notes, moderate green/grassy and woody undertones, and low musky/sweaty. 5) Final mapping: start from geraniol-like baseline, subtract a few points from overall pungency/strength, add a few to flower and sweet, and leave familiarity similar. These adjustments produce the predicted numeric ratings below for Nerol.",30.0,10.0,45.0,35.0,5.0,2.0,12.0,18.0,8.0,3.0,12.0,28.0,5.0,4.0,21.0,25.0,22.0,38.0,75.0,22.0,55.0,62.0,54.0
Isoamyl butyrate,"Analogy (A is to B as C is to D) and reasoning steps:
A = isopentyl (isoamyl) acetate (a well-known banana/fruit ester with dataset profile: fruity, sweet, moderately strong, pleasant and familiar). 
B = amyl/butyrate analogs (butyrate esters of similar alcohols, e.g. amyl butyrate in the dataset) — these tend to be slightly less volatile, a bit warmer, and often a touch richer/rounder than the corresponding acetate, with similar or slightly higher fruit character but modestly altered strength/profile. 
C = ethyl acetate → exemplar of a small acetate ester (high volatility, sharp fruity/solvent top notes). 
D = isoamyl butyrate (query): by the relationship “small acetate → corresponding butyrate” and by direct comparison of similar alcohol cores in the dataset (isopentyl/isobutyl/amyl esters), we predict isoamyl butyrate will be strongly fruity (banana/pear/apple-like), sweet, and edible-smelling, with medium-to-high pleasantness and moderate strength. 
Reasoning steps used to construct predictions:
1) Use nearest structural/odor analogs in the dataset: isopentyl acetate (isopentyl/isopentyl acetate entry) and amyl butyrate (dataset entries) — both typical ester/fruity examples. 
2) Observe patterns: replacing acetate with a slightly larger acyl (butyrate) tends to lower volatility (warmer, rounder note), retain or enhance fruity/sweet perception, and often keeps pleasantness moderate-high while strength remains moderate. 
3) Many short-to-medium chain alkyl butyrates in the dataset (amyl butyrate, propyl butyrate, butyl butyrate, etc.) show high fruit/sweet/pleasant ratings and low off-notes (fish/garlic/ammonia/decayed). Use those empirical trends to set numeric predictions for isoamyl butyrate. 
4) Final mapping: predict strong fruitiness and sweetness, high edible quality, low unpleasant off-notes, medium strength and familiarity/pleasantness similar to other common fruity esters.

Numeric predictions (0-100): each number is an estimated perceptual rating for isoamyl butyrate based on the analogy and dataset trends.",72.0,48.0,66.0,86.0,5.0,1.0,7.0,30.0,9.0,3.0,8.0,38.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,12.0,18.0,14.0,55.0,64.0,58.0
Ethyl heptanoate,"Analogy and reasoning steps:

A (ethyl hexanoate) is to B (ethyl octanoate) as C (ethyl heptanoate) is to D (the predicted profile). 

Reasoning: ethyl hexanoate (C6 acid, ethyl ester) and ethyl octanoate (C8 acid, ethyl ester) are both medium-chain aliphatic ethyl esters with characteristically fruity/sweet/edible notes. Increasing alkyl chain length (C6 -> C8) generally reduces volatility, slightly reduces bright fruity/sweet perception, can reduce ""ammonia/harsh"" or very volatile notes, and can shift odor toward heavier/waxier, slightly more fatty/green or soapy facets. Ethyl heptanoate (C7) lies between C6 and C8 in chain length and thus should have sensory ratings intermediate between ethyl hexanoate and ethyl octanoate for many attributes.

I therefore formed D by interpolating the key sensory attributes of ethyl hexanoate and ethyl octanoate, while also accounting for typical ester character (high fruity/sweet/edible, low sulfur/garlic/fishy). For attributes not explicitly reported for those two entries, I used typical patterns for medium-chain ethyl esters (fairly high edible/sweet/fruit, low unpleasant notes, moderate strength and high pleasantness). Numeric values are chosen as a reasonable midpoint or slightly weighted toward the more common bright fruity character of C6 esters given that ethyl heptanoate is still relatively volatile compared with C8.

Specific steps: 1) identify ethyl hexanoate and ethyl octanoate values for measurable fields (fish, cold, ammonia, decayed, strength, pleasant, familiar) and take an intermediate value for ethyl heptanoate; 2) set ester-typical fields (edible, sweet, fruit, pleasant) high (near those esters); 3) set undesirable notes (garlic, sweaty, ammonia, burnt) low; 4) set textural/warm/waxy descriptors (warm, wood, musky) modestly low-to-moderate because C7 is not strongly musky or woody; 5) provide a consistent overall strength and familiarity between the two reference esters.

These principled interpolations produce the numeric predictions below for ethyl heptanoate.",65.0,35.0,60.0,72.0,15.0,2.0,12.0,21.5,14.0,4.0,20.0,30.0,6.0,5.0,8.0,20.0,10.0,18.0,22.0,10.0,57.0,70.0,58.0
Ethyl octanoate,"Analogy used to predict Ethyl octanoate (D):

A is to B as C is to D

Where:
- A = ethyl hexanoate (shorter C6 ester with well-characterized fruity/sweet, high pleasantness and strength),
- B = the measured rating vector for ethyl hexanoate (high edible/bakery/sweet/fruit, moderate strength/pleasant/familiar),
- C = ethyl decanoate / ethyl heptanoate (longer-chain ethyl esters with lower volatility, lower fruitiness and pleasantness than ethyl hexanoate),
- D = ethyl octanoate (C8, intermediate chain length) whose ratings we want to predict.

Reasoning steps (analogy mapping and interpolation):
1. Structural analogy: ethyl esters differing only by alkyl chain length form a homologous series. Increasing chain length reduces volatility, typically decreasing perceived fruity/sweet top notes and overall apparent strength while sometimes increasing fatty/waxy/neutral notes.
2. Empirical anchor (A→B): ethyl hexanoate (C6) shows strong fruity/sweet/edible/bakery character and high pleasantness/strength in the provided dataset.
3. Empirical anchors for longer chains (C): ethyl heptanoate (C7) and ethyl decanoate (C10) in the dataset show progressively reduced fruitiness, sweetness, pleasantness and perceived intensity relative to ethyl hexanoate.
4. Interpolation: Ethyl octanoate (C8) will lie between the C7 and C10 examples, closer to C7 for many perceptual qualities but with somewhat reduced volatility/fruitiness relative to C6. Therefore predict moderate-to-high fruity/sweet/edible ratings, somewhat lower strength and pleasantness than ethyl hexanoate but higher than ethyl decanoate.
5. Side attributes: fish/garlic/ammonia/decay/musky/sweaty should be low for a straight-chain fatty/ethyl ester; floral notes moderate-low; bakery/edible/sweet/fruit relatively prominent.
6. Final predicted numeric ratings are interpolated/estimated from the homologous-series trend while keeping values consistent with similar esters in the dataset.

These steps map the known behavior of A→B (C6) and C→(observed C7/C10) onto C8 to produce D.

Propyl propionate,"Analogy used: Methyl propionate is to Ethyl propionate as Ethyl propionate is to Propyl propionate. Reasoning steps: 1) Find the measured change going from methyl -> ethyl propionate (A -> B). From the dataset: methyl propionate (A) = fish 13.33, cold 17.20, ammonia 23.50, decayed 16.43, strength 31.77, pleasant 55.75, familiar 42.91; ethyl propionate (B) = fish 24.14, cold 24.79, ammonia 26.00, decayed 19.38, strength 66.28, pleasant 36.23, familiar 48.02. Delta (B-A) = +10.81 (fish), +7.59 (cold), +2.50 (ammonia), +2.95 (decayed), +34.51 (strength), -19.52 (pleasant), +5.11 (familiar). 2) Apply the analogous molecular-step to go from ethyl -> propyl (C -> D). Directly applying the full delta would over-extrapolate (especially for strength), so I used a moderated (half) of the observed A->B delta to estimate C->D (this approximates diminishing incremental effects of adding chain length). Half-deltas: +5.41 (fish), +3.79 (cold), +1.25 (ammonia), +1.48 (decayed), +17.26 (strength), -9.76 (pleasant), +2.56 (familiar). Add half-deltas to ethyl propionate (C) to get raw estimates: fish ~29.55, cold ~28.58, ammonia ~27.25, decayed ~20.86, strength ~83.54, pleasant ~26.47, familiar ~50.58. 3) Calibrate the raw estimates with odor chemistry knowledge of medium-chain esters: propyl propionate is a fruity, sweet, pleasant ester (apple/pear-like), typically rated high on fruit/sweet/edible/pleasant and moderate-to-high on strength but less extreme than >80 strength. Also compare with similar esters in the dataset (propyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl hexanoate) to set realistic pleasantness and strength. Therefore I moderated strength downward from the raw 83.5 to ~70 (still fairly strong but not extreme) and raised pleasantness to ~65 (consistent with common fruity esters). Familiar was kept near the linear estimate (~60). 4) For attributes not present in the methyl/ethyl pair (edible, bakery, sweet, fruit, garlic, spices, sour, burnt, acid, warm, musky, sweaty, wood, grass, flower, chemical) I used known odor character of propyl propionate (fruity, sweet, food/flavor use) and analogous ester values to assign reasonable scores: high edible/fruit/sweet, moderate bakery/flower, low fish/garlic/musky/sweaty/ammonia/decayed. Final numeric predictions (0-100) are given below.",75.0,45.0,65.0,80.0,12.0,1.0,10.0,28.0,15.0,5.0,18.0,25.0,5.0,5.0,15.0,15.0,10.0,15.0,20.0,30.0,70.0,65.0,60.0
p-cresol,"Analogy used (A is to B as C is to D) and reasoning steps:

A: 4‑propylphenol (a para‑alkyl phenol in the dataset) is to B: its measured sensory profile (moderately phenolic, woody/medicinal, moderate strength, moderate pleasantness) as

C: known strong alkylphenol examples (2‑ethylphenol and guaiacol) are to D: p‑cresol (4‑methylphenol), which is expected to be a phenolic odor shifted toward higher volatility, greater ""barnyard/decayed/animalic"" character and higher perceived strength because the smaller para‑substituent (methyl) typically increases volatility and the classic odor descriptions of p‑cresol emphasize fecal/horse‑barn and medicinal/phenolic notes.

How the analogy was applied to produce numbers:
1) I used the sensory profiles of three dataset neighbors as the baseline: 2‑ethylphenol (weight 0.50, very strong, somewhat unpleasant), 4‑propylphenol (weight 0.30, phenolic but less extreme), and guaiacol (weight 0.20, phenolic/smoky but often more pleasant). These represent the typical phenolic/alkylphenol family behaviors.
2) For each attribute I computed a simple weighted baseline (0.5*2‑ethylphenol + 0.3*4‑propylphenol + 0.2*guaiacol) to capture an expected phenolic profile for a para‑alkyl phenol.
3) I then adjusted that baseline according to known qualitative chemistry/olfactory facts for p‑cresol: the para‑methyl increases volatility relative to larger alkyl groups, and published olfactory descriptions emphasize strong fecal/barnyard, animalic, sweaty and phenolic (chemical/tar) notes. Those lead to (a) an increase in perceived strength, (b) a large increase in decayed/animalic/sweaty/chemical ratings, and (c) a reduction in pleasantness compared with the baseline.
4) Attributes not strongly related to phenolic/animalic character (bakery, sweet, fruit, flower, grass) were left very low. Attributes related to phenolic / smoky / medicinal character (burnt, wood, spices, chemical) were raised moderately. Ammonia, sweaty and decayed were raised substantially to reflect the characteristic barnyard/fecal impression of p‑cresol.
5) Final numbers are bounded 0–100 and represent the best quantitative estimate consistent with the analogy and the dataset neighbors.

Selected example of the numeric thinking (strength and decayed):
- Baseline strength (weighted average) ≈ 0.5*75.7 + 0.3*55.3 + 0.2*58.6 ≈ 66.2. Because p‑cresol is more volatile and often perceived as very strong, I increased that baseline by ~18% → predicted strength ≈ 78.
- Baseline decayed ≈ 0.5*11.2 + 0.3*28 + 0.2*25 ≈ 19.0. Given p‑cresol’s classic fecal/barnyard character, I increased decayed substantially to reflect the animalic/fecal impression → predicted decayed ≈ 60.

These same qualitative adjustments were applied across the rest of the attributes to produce the final predicted profile for p‑cresol.",5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,20.0,5.0,25.0,22.0,8.0,30.0,12.0,28.0,40.0,50.0,30.0,60.0,35.0,8.0,5.0,65.0,78.0,20.0,50.0
dimethyl succinate,"Analogy used: Diethyl succinate (A) : known sensory profile (B) :: Dimethyl succinate (C) : predicted sensory profile (D).

Reasoning steps (explicit):
1) Identify a close structural analogue: A = diethyl succinate is the diethyl ester of succinic acid; C = dimethyl succinate is the dimethyl ester (same succinate backbone, smaller alkyl groups). Both are simple aliphatic di-esters (R-OOC-CH2-CH2-COO-R) so they share the same functional-group-driven odor character (fruity/ester-like, edible/winey/pleasant).
2) Determine how the structural change (ethyl -> methyl) typically affects olfactory attributes: replacing ethyl with smaller methyl groups decreases molecular weight and increases volatility and vapor pressure. In esters this typically increases perceived freshness/fruitiness and often increases odor strength (more molecules in the headspace), while sometimes introducing a slightly more solvent/chemical edge and slightly reducing warm/round/“fatty” notes associated with larger alkyl chains.
3) Compare to examples in the dataset: diethyl succinate (existing data) is already rated fairly pleasant and moderately strong. Small methyl esters in the dataset (e.g., methyl butyrate, methyl acetate, methyl propionate) tend to score higher on fruit/sweet/edible and have high strength/pleasantness than their ethyl analogues. Use that pattern to shift diethyl succinate’s profile toward increased fruit/sweet/edible and slightly higher strength for dimethyl succinate, while keeping low off-notes (fish, garlic, sweaty, ammonia, decayed).
4) Translate qualitative shifts into numeric adjustments: Start from diethyl succinate’s character (fruity, pleasant, moderate strength) and increase fruit/sweet/edible by a modest amount (reflecting greater volatility), slightly increase strength, leave negative attributes near-zero, slightly increase chemical/solvent character (small esters sometimes feel more ‘chemical’), and reduce “warm/woody” qualities (those favor larger, heavier molecules).
5) Produce numeric predictions (0–100) for D (dimethyl succinate) consistent with the above adjustments and with ranges seen in similar esters in the dataset.

Attribute-by-attribute rationale summary:
- Edible, Sweet, Fruit: esters are characteristically fruity/sweet and food-associated. Smaller methyl ester increases perceived fruitiness and edible quality relative to diethyl.
- Bakery: not a baked-goods ester (low).
- Fish, Garlic, Spices, Sweaty, Ammonia, Decayed: no sulfur or amine groups; keep near zero/low.
- Cold: moderate (many small esters register some fresh/cold sensation in dataset). 
- Sour/Acid/Burnt: low for simple esters (no strong acid/roast notes).
- Warm/Wood/Grass/Flower: modest floral/green in low-to-moderate range; less warm/woody than larger esters/lactones.
- Chemical: small esters can show a detectable solvent/chemical edge; modest score.
- Strength, Pleasant, Familiar: modestly high strength due to volatility; pleasant and familiar similar to other common small esters.

Predicted numeric values for dimethyl succinate (D):",55.0,15.0,50.0,65.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,36.0,10.0,5.0,12.0,18.0,5.0,3.0,18.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,25.0,28.0,65.0,59.0,50.0
3-octanone,"Analogy (used to derive predictions):
A is to B as C is to D
Where:
A = 2‑octanone (well characterized in the provided dataset) with measured odor profile values (fish ~15.3, cold ~24.0, ammonia ~17.7, decayed ~19.8, strength ~50.45, pleasant ~52.43, familiar ~46.57, etc.).
B = the known perceptual profile of 2‑octanone (the “reference” molecule).
C = the structural change: moving the carbonyl from the 2‑position to the 3‑position in the same eight‑carbon backbone (i.e. going from 2‑octanone to 3‑octanone). This is a small, local change that typically reduces the alpha‑effect (conjugation/activation at an alpha position), slightly lowers volatility and pungency, and can shift character subtly toward softer, rounder, slightly fruitier/waxy notes.
D = predicted perceptual profile for 3‑octanone.
Reasoning steps applying the analogy:
1) Base: start from the 2‑octanone measurements (B) because 2‑ and 3‑octanone are positional isomers and share the same molecular formula and similar lipophilicity/volatility.
2) Structural effect: moving the carbonyl to the 3‑position typically (a) reduces the alpha‑carbon activation that often yields sharper, more “chemical” / pungent notes, so overall intensity/strength should drop somewhat, and “chemical”/pungent attributes should decrease slightly; (b) slightly reduces volatility and puts more emphasis on softer, waxy, slightly fruity or green aspects; (c) doesn’t create new strong sulfur/amine/acid characters, so attributes like garlic, ammonia, sweaty remain low.
3) Empirical anchoring: compare other ketones in the dataset (e.g., 2‑heptanone, 2‑nonanone, other mid‑chain methyl/alkanones) where moving the carbonyl inward or increasing chain length tends to modestly reduce strength and pungency and produce comparable pleasantness. Use those consistent patterns to adjust specific attribute values from B toward D.
4) Attribute adjustments (how numbers were chosen):
   - Strength: reduce ~8–12% from 2‑octanone (from ~50.5 → ~45) because the 3‑position commonly yields a milder impression.
   - Chemical/pungent markers (ammonia, chemical): remain moderate but slightly lower (ammonia ~same to slightly lower ~17.7; chemical slightly less than 2‑octanone analogue ~48).
   - Fruit/sweet/bakery/edible: small positive shift (softer/waxier, slightly fruitier) compared with a 2‑position methyl ketone, but not extremely fruity — modest increases.
   - Fish/decayed/rot: low‑to‑moderate and similar or slightly reduced compared with 2‑octanone (no new off‑notes expected).
   - Warm/wood/grass/flower/musky: modest low–moderate values consistent with medium aliphatic ketones: some warm/waxy/green character but not dominant.
   - Sweaty/garlic/burnt/acid/sour: stay low because structure doesn’t introduce these modalities.
5) Final numeric predictions reflect the anchored baseline (2‑octanone) plus the directional structural adjustments above.

Note: these are perceptual predictions based on structure–odor heuristics and comparative data for related aliphatic ketones; absolute human ratings can vary by panel and concentration.",36.0,20.0,30.0,28.0,14.0,3.0,16.0,24.0,8.0,6.0,8.0,30.0,12.0,10.0,17.7,20.0,10.0,16.0,18.0,48.0,45.0,52.0,46.0
methyl caproate,"Analogy: Methyl butyrate is to methyl valerate as methyl valerate is to methyl caproate. Reasoning steps: (1) These three molecules are members of the straight-chain saturated methyl ester series differing by one methylene unit each (butyrate C4, valerate C5, caproate/hexanoate C6). (2) Empirical odor trends along this series: short-chain methyl esters (C4–C5) are strongly fruity, sweet and perceived as edible; as chain length increases to C6 the fruity/sweet character typically remains but shifts slightly toward fuller, slightly fatty/ripe notes and the pure “sharp” ester top-notes soften. (3) Therefore to predict methyl caproate (methyl hexanoate) I interpolate from known values for methyl butyrate/methyl valerate and similar C6 esters (ethyl hexanoate, hexyl acetate) — raising fruit and sweet/pleasant ratings relative to short-chain esters, keeping low ‘‘off’’ notes (fish, garlic, ammonia, decayed), and a moderate overall intensity (strength). (4) I also account for a small increase in fatty/acidic character vs C4–C5 esters (slightly higher acid/warmer/grass/woodish hints) but not large. From that analogy and interpolation I assign the following numeric scent-perception ratings for methyl caproate.",65.0,10.0,60.0,75.0,5.0,1.0,10.0,22.0,10.0,2.0,15.0,30.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,8.0,15.0,20.0,10.0,35.0,70.0,55.0
Methyl heptanoate,"Analogy: Methyl caproate (methyl hexanoate) is to methyl caprylate (methyl octanoate) as methyl heptanoate is to D. Reasoning steps: 1) Methyl esters with short-to-medium alkyl chains (methyl butyrate, methyl valerate, methyl hexanoate) are characterized by high fruity, sweet and edible notes, moderate pleasantness and moderate strength. 2) As chain length increases (hexanoate -> heptanoate -> octanoate), volatility decreases, fruitiness and sharp sweet top-notes soften slightly, and the odor becomes a bit waxier/‘warmer’ and less piercing; unpleasant notes (fishy, sulfur/ammonia, decayed) generally remain low across these esters. 3) Empirical anchors from the dataset: methyl caproate (methyl hexanoate) shows distinctly fruity/sweet/pleasant character with moderate strength; methyl caprylate (methyl octanoate) shows similar but slightly less volatile/fruity and somewhat waxier character. Ethyl/heptyl analogues (ethyl heptanoate, heptyl acetate) further support that increasing chain length modestly lowers the high-frequency 'fresh fruit' impression and shifts toward softer/waxy/fatty warmth. 4) Therefore by interpolation between methyl hexanoate and methyl octanoate (and considering ethyl heptanoate data), methyl heptanoate should be strongly fruity and sweet, clearly edible/pleasant, with low fish/garlic/amine/decay, slightly warmer/waxier than methyl hexanoate and of moderate odor strength and familiarity. Predicted numeric ratings reflect that interpolation and the typical ester profile.",60.0,30.0,55.0,68.0,8.0,2.0,12.0,26.0,12.0,3.0,14.0,38.0,10.0,7.0,15.0,10.0,18.0,20.0,25.0,22.0,48.0,62.0,52.0
1-Methyl-3-methoxy-4-isopropylbenzene,"Analogy used to reach the predictions:
A is anisole (simple methoxybenzene) and B is 4‑methylanisole (anisole with an extra alkyl on the ring). Anisole : 4‑methylanisole :: 1,3‑dimethoxybenzene : 1‑methyl‑3‑methoxy‑4‑isopropylbenzene (target).
Reasoning steps:
1) Anisole (COC6H5) is a prototypical sweet/phenolic/anisic aroma with moderate strength. Adding an alkyl at the ring para position (4‑methylanisole) preserves the anisic sweet/floral character but typically raises perceived pleasantness and keeps strength similar. Thus anisole -> 4‑methylanisole indicates that alkylation increases warmth/pleasantness without creating pungent off‑notes.
2) 1,3‑Dimethoxybenzene (two methoxy substituents) shows a related, somewhat sweeter/warmer aromatic profile than anisole. Replacing one of the hydrogen positions with a bulky alkyl (isopropyl) plus a small methyl will analogously push the molecule toward a more hydrophobic, warmer, slightly stronger aromatic note while keeping the anisic / sweet / floral character.
3) Additional comparison: other ring‑alkylated anisoles (allylanisole, isopropylated aromatics) tend to increase 'warm' and 'spicy/woody' impressions, increase overall strength and pleasantness, and reduce 'cold' or green facets. They do not introduce strong sulfur/garlic/fishy/ammoniacal off‑notes.
4) Therefore predict target = anisole‑type baseline (sweet, floral, moderate strength) + adjustments: slightly higher strength and warmth, higher pleasantness and bakery/sweet impressions, low fruit/fish/garlic/ammonia/decay, modest spicy/woody facets because of the isopropyl group.
Quantitative adjustments were chosen by averaging known anisole/di‑methoxybenzene/para‑alkylated anisole data and nudging values up for strength/warm/pleasant and up modestly for bakery/sweet/wood/spices, while keeping off‑note scales low.

Isoamylamine,"Analogy and reasoning steps:
A is to B as C is to D
A = Butylamine (a straight C4 primary amine) with a known sensory profile dominated by ammonia-like, fishy and pungent notes.  (Reference: dataset entry for butylamine: pronounced ammonia/fishy character, moderate intensity.)
B = Butylamine's odor profile (ammoniacal/fishy, moderate unpleasantness, modest intensity).
C = Isoamylamine (a C5 branched primary amine: same functional group as butylamine but one extra carbon and a branched ""isoamyl"" chain).
D = Predicted odor profile for Isoamylamine.
Reasoning steps using the analogy:
1) Functional-group dominance: Primary amines are defined by ammonia-like, fishy, and sweaty attributes. Because isoamylamine and butylamine share the same functional group (–NH2), the dominant qualitative features (ammonia, fishy, chemical/pungent) should be preserved in D.
2) Chain length and branching shift intensity and secondary character: Moving from a straight butyl chain (A) to a branched isoamyl chain (C) typically increases hydrophobicity and can increase perceived intensity of body/""sweaty"" and persistent pungency while sometimes reducing sharp high-note volatility. Empirical support from the dataset: comparing straight lower alcohols to branched isoamyl alcohols shows branching often elevates overall strength and low-nuance ""sweaty/animalic"" character. Applying a similar shift, expect isoamylamine to be as ammonia/fishy-dominated as butylamine but with higher overall intensity, more sweaty/body, and somewhat greater ""decayed/animalic"" shading.
3) Quantitative adjustment by analogy: Starting from butylamine baseline (noted ammonia/fishy values in dataset), I increase ammonia and sweaty/decayed contributions and intensity (strength) to reflect the effect of adding one carbon and branching. I keep edible/bakery/flower/fruit/wood/grass/flower attributes very low because amines rarely give pleasant fruity/bakery/flowery notes. I raise the ""chemical"" descriptor since small aliphatic amines are clearly chemical/pungent. ""Pleasant"" is lowered (amines are typically rated unpleasant at typical concentrations); ""familiar"" is moderate (amines are recognizable but not commonly pleasant).
4) Final predicted numeric values are therefore a branched-primary-amine variant of butylamine: stronger ammonia and sweaty/fishy/decayed and higher overall strength and chemical character, with low food-like, floral, or woody notes.
Note: predictions are relative estimates based on structural analogy and trends in the dataset (primary amines and comparisons between straight vs branched aliphatic homologs).",10.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,45.0,10.0,12.0,25.0,30.0,5.0,30.0,20.0,25.0,50.0,65.0,40.0,8.0,8.0,3.0,75.0,60.0,20.0,35.0
butyric acid,"Analogy and reasoning steps:
A (acetic acid) is to B (propionic acid) as C (propionic acid) is to D (butyric acid).
Rationale: acetic -> propionic represents increasing alkyl chain length (C2 -> C3) and the observed changes in odor descriptors in the dataset. I applied the same directional change (B minus A) to propionic (C) to estimate butyric (D) as 2*B - A for the descriptors that had explicit values in the provided table (fish, cold, ammonia, decayed, strength, pleasant, familiar). This yields a first-pass numerical estimate for those descriptors. Then I adjusted other odor dimensions by combining: (1) the analogy-derived values where applicable, (2) chemical/olfactory knowledge about butyric (butanoic) acid — characteristically rancid/cheesy/sweaty, sour and strongly acidic — and (3) typical trends seen in the dataset for short-chain carboxylic acids (moderate-to-high intensity, prominent sour/acid notes, sweaty/decayed character, low floral/woody). Where the pure delta gave implausible negative values (e.g., decayed), I clamped to the 0–100 range and adjusted upward because butyric is strongly associated with rancidity/decay. Final numeric predictions combine the analogy calculation with these domain adjustments and are given below.",10.0,15.0,2.0,1.0,31.0,5.0,10.0,26.0,70.0,5.0,80.0,25.0,5.0,65.0,17.0,55.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,70.0,45.0,25.0,50.0
beta-Alanine,"Analogy and reasoning steps:
A is Glycine (NH2-CH2-COOH) and B is L-Alanine (CH3-CH(NH2)-COOH). Observed data: Glycine shows relatively high ammoniacal/amine character (ammonia ≈ 39.8), moderate ""cold""/volatile sensation (cold ≈ 31.4), moderate ""strength"" (≈ 38.5) and reasonably high pleasantness (≈ 57.2). L-Alanine (which has an extra methyl substituent on the alpha carbon) shows lower ammonia (≈ 19.6), lower ""cold"" (≈ 26.8), lower strength (≈ 24.1) and somewhat lower pleasantness (≈ 51.3). The change glycine→alanine (addition of a small hydrophobic methyl) correlates with reduced perceived amine/ammonia, reduced volatility/cold sensation and generally milder odor strength.
Apply the same structural-to-odor mapping as an analogy: C is beta-Alanine (NH2-CH2-CH2-COOH) and D is the unknown scent profile. Beta-Alanine is an isomer of alanine/glycine family: same molecular formula as alanine but the amino group is on the beta carbon (one extra CH2 between NH2 and COOH compared with glycine). Placing the amine one carbon farther from the carboxyl typically reduces the direct alpha-amino acid character but preserves some amine volatility compared to an alpha-amino acid with an extra methyl. Therefore by analogy: glycine (primary, short-chain amino acid) → high ammonia/amine; alanine (alpha substituted) → lower ammonia/volatile; beta-alanine (beta-amino acid) should lie between glycine and alanine for amine/ammonia, cold/volatile and decayed sensations, and have moderate strength and modest pleasantness/familiarity (it is not a standard protein amino acid, so familiarity should be lower than common protein amino acids). For other semantic categories (edible, bakery, sweet, fruit, floral, wood, spices, garlic, burnt, musky, sweaty, etc.) small polar amino acids in the dataset score low-to-moderate; I therefore assign low values in those modalities, with slightly elevated ‘‘acid’’/‘‘sour’’/""chemical"" character because of the free carboxylic acid + amine group.
Numeric interpolation method used: for ammonia/cold/strength/decayed/familiar/pleasant I interpolated between Glycine and L-Alanine values according to the structural position of the amino group (beta-Alanine expected to be intermediate), with a slight bias toward glycine for amine character (because the free primary amine is still present and relatively exposed). For semantic categories without direct analogs I used typical scores of small amino acids and small polar molecules from the dataset (low bakery/fruit/flower/wood, low garlic/spices/burnt), and modest ""chemical"" and ""acid"" ratings.
Predicted scent profile for beta-Alanine (values 0-100):
- fish: interpolated between Glycine (≈19.8) and Alanine (≈15) → 17.0
- cold: between 31.4 and 26.8 → 28.0
- ammonia: between 39.8 and 19.6, biased toward glycine → 30.0
- decayed: between 19.2 and 10.8 → 15.0
- strength: between 38.5 and 24.1 → 28.0
- pleasant: somewhat lower than glycine/alanine average because of lower familiarity → 45.0
- familiar: lower than common protein amino acids → 30.0
Other semantic attributes set consistently with a small, polar amine/acid molecule (low bakery/fruit/flower/spices/garlic, mild acid/chemical, low musky/sweaty): I used conservative low-to-moderate values.

isopropyl acetate,"Analogy: Ethyl acetate is to propyl acetate as propyl acetate is to isopropyl acetate.

Reasoning steps (how the analogy is used to predict isopropyl acetate's profile):
1) Choose a simple homologous series of small alkyl acetates (ethyl acetate -> propyl acetate -> isopropyl acetate). Ethyl acetate (straight C2) and propyl acetate (straight C3) in the provided data show typical ester/fruit/solvent characters with moderate pleasantness and moderate strength. Moving from ethyl -> propyl mainly changes volatility and fruitiness/solvent notes slightly.
2) Use a second comparison of branching: compare straight-chain propyl/isobutyl examples to branched isopropyl/isobutyl forms (isobutyl acetate and isopropenyl acetate entries). Branching on the alkyl side tends to increase the sweet/fruity/pear/banana character and sometimes increases perceived solvent/chemical edge, while pleasantness often remains moderate to high for these esters.
3) Combine both trends: starting from ethyl acetate (moderate pleasant, fruity) then to propyl acetate (slightly different volatility and similar pleasantness) and applying the branching effect (as seen for isobutyl acetate and isopropenyl acetate) predicts that isopropyl acetate will be a fruity, sweet, somewhat solvent-like acetate with good pleasantness and familiarity, moderate strength, low off-notes (fish/garlic/sweaty/ammonia/decay), and low burnt/wood/musky qualities.
4) Calibrate magnitudes using nearby examples in the dataset: ethyl acetate (pleasant ~45), propyl acetate (pleasant ~46), isobutyl acetate (pleasant ~61) and other small acetates (many show strong fruit/sweet ratings). Therefore isopropyl acetate should score higher than ethyl/propyl on fruit/sweet/edible/pleasant, but similar/moderate on strength and chemical (solvent) character, and low on unpleasant/off-note axes.
5) Final numerical estimates are interpolated/extrapolated from those analogous compounds and general olfactory chemistry rules: small acetate esters = fruity/sweet/pleasant; branching increases fruity/pear/banana sweetness; esters are not musky, burnt, or garlicky.

Isopropenyl acetate,"Analogy: Isopropyl acetate is to isopropenyl acetate as ethyl acetate (a saturated small ester) is to vinyl acetate (the analogous unsaturated/vinylic ester). Reasoning steps: 
1) Identify a close saturated analogue with data: isopropyl acetate (CC(C)OC(=O)C) in the dataset is a short secondary alkyl acetate with a typically fruity/ester, slightly solvent-like odor (pleasant ~47, moderate intensity). 
2) Identify the effect of introducing a C=C (vinylic/allylic) substitution on the alcohol side of an acetate from dataset patterns: esters with an unsaturated (allylic or vinylic) alkyl group (for example trans-2-hexenyl acetate, cis-3-hexenyl acetate, other allylic/vinylic acetates) show a shift toward greener/leafy or slightly sharper “chemical” notes, somewhat higher ‘cold/green’ character and grassiness, sometimes a bit more solvent/chemical impression and modestly altered pleasantness relative to the saturated analogues. 
3) Apply that typical shift to isopropyl acetate → isopropenyl acetate: expect retention of ester/fruity and sweet character (esters are flavor/fragrance-active), but increased green/chemical/volatile sharpness (higher “chemical” and “cold” ratings), somewhat higher grass/green note, slightly higher ammonia/solvent impression, and a small reduction (or similar) in overall pleasant/familiar ratings compared with the saturated isopropyl acetate. Intensity (strength) remains moderate (volatile small ester). 
4) Calibrate magnitudes using measured examples: isopropyl acetate pleasant ~46–47 and cold ~39; trans/cis-hexenyl acetates (unsaturated esters) show notably stronger green/grass and comparable pleasantness. Thus predicted shifts: fruit/sweet remain relatively high, bakery/wood/musky/garlic/spices remain low, chemical and grass/cold a bit higher, pleasantness slightly lower/moderate. 
Prediction uncertainty: moderate — small structural changes can produce varied percepts, but the general ester → enol/allylic ester trend (more green/chemical) is well-supported.",50.0,18.0,54.0,62.0,4.0,1.0,8.0,42.0,18.0,4.0,12.0,28.0,3.0,8.0,20.0,22.0,6.0,36.0,30.0,48.0,42.0,44.0,38.0
gamma-valerolactone,"Gamma-decalactone (A) is to its sensory profile (B) as gamma‑valerolactone (C) is to the predicted sensory profile (D).

Reasoning steps using the analogy:
1) Structural analogy: both A and C are gamma‑lactones (a five‑membered lactone ring) and share the same lactone functional group that gives characteristic sweet/creamy/lactonic notes. The primary structural difference is alkyl chain length: gamma‑decalactone has a much longer hydrophobic side chain than gamma‑valerolactone (GVL), while 4‑hydroxybutanoic‑type lactones are even smaller. In odor chemistry, the lactone ring imparts the characteristic creamy/peachy/fruity character, and the alkyl chain length modulates intensity and the specific quality (longer chains → stronger, richer, more fatty/peachy; shorter chains → more volatile, less fatty, sometimes slightly solventlike).

2) Empirical mapping from dataset: gamma‑decalactone and other medium/long lactones in the dataset show high 'fruit' and high 'pleasant' ratings and moderate-to-high strength. Small lactones or small cyclic esters (e.g., 4‑hydroxybutanoic lactone) show lower fruity intensity and lower pleasantness/strength. GVL sits between these: it retains the lactone’s sweet/creamy/faintly fruity character but, because of its shorter alkyl portion and higher volatility, the fruity/lactonic note is less intense and a bit cleaner/more solvent-like compared with long-chain gamma-lactones.

3) Translating into attributes: therefore predict GVL to be moderately strong (lower than long-chain lactones), fairly pleasant and food-like, with notable sweetness and moderate fruity/lactone character; negligible scores for fish/garlic/sweaty/ammonia/decay; modest 'bakery'/'warm'/'edible' associations because lactones often appear in food aromas; a small 'chemical' character due to solvent‑like volatility.

4) Quantitative scaling: I reduced the strength and fruitfulness relative to long-chain gamma-lactones (based on dataset examples) while keeping sweet and pleasant moderately high. Other off-note categories are set near zero.",55.0,40.0,60.0,50.0,2.0,1.0,8.0,20.0,8.0,3.0,12.0,35.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,8.0,5.0,12.0,20.0,35.0,60.0,45.0
"2,6-Dimethylpyridine","Analogy (used to make the prediction): Benzene is to toluene as pyridine is to 2,6-dimethylpyridine. Reasoning steps: 1) Methyl substitution on an aromatic heterocycle increases alkyl (hydrocarbon) character and steric bulk while reducing the relative exposure of a heteroatom’s lone pair. In the benzene→toluene example the ring keeps an aromatic/basic character but gains a warmer, more alkyl note and slightly different intensity/profile. 2) Pyridine’s characteristic ""sharp/amine/ammonia-like"" note arises from the exposed nitrogen lone pair. Placing methyl groups at the 2 and 6 positions (ortho to N) sterically shields that lone pair and increases the molecule’s hydrophobic/alkyl character; thus the pure pyridine-like ""cold/ammonia"" quality should be reduced but not eliminated. 3) Steric/hydrophobic modification often alters perceived intensity and adds a more ""chemical/alkyl"" or ""musty/oily"" facet; 2,6-dimethyl substitution typically makes the smell less purely pyridinic and somewhat more pungent/chemical in a different way. 4) Therefore, compared with pyridine (dataset reference: pyridine: cold ~56.5, ammonia ~54.5, strength ~17.8, pleasant ~50.0, familiar ~31.3), 2,6-dimethylpyridine is predicted to have: reduced ammonia and ""cold"" ratings, increased perceived chemical/pungent character and overall odor strength (more noticeable/more alkyl/pungent), lower pleasantness, and similar-to-slightly-lower familiarity. The numeric ratings below reflect these adjustments and the qualitative patterns observed for methylated aromatics and substituted pyridines in the supplied dataset.",15.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,8.0,45.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,20.0,10.0,10.0,40.0,20.0,8.0,6.0,3.0,60.0,55.0,25.0,30.0
Cyclohexanone,"Analogy: Cyclopentanone (A) is to its known sensory profile (B) as Cyclohexanone (C) is to the predicted sensory profile (D).

Reasoning steps: 
1) Start from cyclopentanone (A -> B): cyclopentanone in the dataset is a fairly strong, solvent/ketone note (high strength, modest pleasantness, moderate ammonia/chemical character). Increasing ring size from C5 to C6 (A -> C) generally lowers volatility and often softens the sharp, solvent-like edge while keeping the characteristic ketone/chemical character. 
2) Use nearest neighbors to refine: 2-methylcyclohexanone and cycloheptanone in the data both show somewhat lower ‘pungent/sharp’ ratings than cyclopentanone and somewhat higher pleasantness/familiarity compared with C5 ketones. Linear aliphatic ketones like 2-hexanone and 3-octanone show moderate strength and moderate pleasantness; acetone shows much higher ammonia/solvent character. Combining these trends, cyclohexanone should be: clearly chemical/solvent-like (high 'chemical'), moderately strong but a bit less sharply pungent than cyclopentanone, moderately pleasant and moderately familiar. 
3) Attribute-by-attribute adjustments: ""edible"" and ""bakery"" are very low because cyclohexanone is not a food-like lactone/ester; ""sweet"" is modest (some ketones have a slight sweet/solvent sweet impression); ""fruit/flower/wood/grass"" are low because the molecule is a simple alicyclic ketone without fruity/floral estery notes; ""fish/garlic/spices"" are minimal; ""cold"" (cool/volatile impression) is moderate (less than very volatile small ketones but not negligible); ""ammonia/decayed/sweaty"" are low-to-moderate reflecting some sharp/animalic notes sometimes reported for ketones; ""chemical"" is high reflecting solvent-like character; ""strength/pleasant/familiar"" are set by averaging trends from C5–C7 ketones and linear ketones. 
4) Final numeric predictions are thus produced by interpolating between cyclopentanone (C5), 2-methylcyclohexanone (C6 analogue), cycloheptanone (C7) and representative aliphatic ketones (2-hexanone, 3-octanone) to capture ring-size and ketone-type effects.

Predicted profile (D) follows from these adjustments: lower sharpness than cyclopentanone but still pronounced chemical/solvent note, modest sweetness, low food/fruity/floral character, moderate pleasantness and familiarity.",10.0,6.0,25.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,8.0,24.0,7.0,5.0,12.0,30.0,15.0,20.0,26.0,20.0,18.0,10.0,12.0,65.0,56.0,40.0,46.0
Benzenethiol,"A is to B as C is to D:

A = o-Toluenethiol (an aromatic thiol with a methyl substituent; dataset entry 166). B = toluene/parent aromatic (non-thiol aromatic). C = benzenethiol (the query). D = benzene (the parent aromatic). 

Reasoning steps using the analogy and data: 
1) The transformation “parent aromatic → aromatic thiol” (B → A) in the dataset consistently introduces strong sulfur/mercaptan character: large increases in perceived ""strength"", ""chemical""/""decayed""/""ammonia""/""sweaty"" notes and decreases in ""pleasant"", ""edible"", ""floral"", ""sweet"" attributes. For example, o-Toluenethiol (entry 166) shows high strength (~59) and elevated decayed/ammonia-type ratings versus typical simple aromatics (e.g. benzene/ethylbenzene entries have low pleasant chemical/skunky notes). 
2) Other aromatic thiols in the set (2-methoxythiophenol, entry 390; and aliphatic thiols like cyclopentanethiol, entry 200) confirm the same pattern: very high strength (often 60–85), elevated decayed/ammonia/sweaty/fish aspects, and low edible/bakery/fruit/flower. Substituents (methyl, methoxy, alkyl) modulate intensity and pleasantness somewhat: electron-donating groups or steric bulk can slightly reduce volatility or alter odor character, but the dominant thiol signature persists. 
3) Using the A:B :: C:D analogy, benzenethiol (C) should show the characteristic thiol/mercaptan profile relative to benzene (D): strong, sulfurous/chemical/decayed/garlic-like character; low fruity/bake/floral/sweet; moderate familiarity but low pleasantness. 
4) I triangulated expected numeric ratings by averaging trends from aromatic thiols (o-Toluenethiol, 2-methoxythiophenol) and representative aliphatic thiols (cyclopentanethiol, branched alkyl thiols) to capture typical strength and unpleasant sulfur attributes for an unsubstituted aromatic thiol. Substituent effects (methyl, methoxy) in the dataset suggest benzenethiol will be roughly as strong or slightly stronger than o-toluenethiol and 2-methoxythiophenol, and less pleasant than many oxygenated aromatics.

Predicted perceptual profile for benzenethiol (C6H5SH) follows directly from that analogy and the numeric triangulation from dataset examples.",10.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,25.0,65.0,20.0,20.0,15.0,18.0,10.0,25.0,10.0,30.0,30.0,38.0,10.0,8.0,5.0,60.0,75.0,25.0,50.0
Octyl isobutyrate,"A is to B as C is to D:

A = cis-3-hexenyl isobutyrate (a relatively volatile, fruity-green isobutyrate ester with reported pleasant ~58). B = octyl isovalerate (a longer-chain octyl ester of a branched acid; reported pleasant ~26). C = a short/medium-chain isobutyrate ester (gives bright fruity/sweet notes), D = octyl isobutyrate (the query).

Reasoning steps using this analogy:
1) Compare A→B: moving from a medium/short-chain isobutyrate/related ester to an octyl (C8) ester typically reduces volatility, mutes bright top-note fruitiness, and shifts the profile toward waxy/soapy/softer fruity impressions; perceived strength often drops or moves toward a lower, rounder presence. Octyl isovalerate (B) demonstrates how a long octyl chain plus a branched acid can substantially change pleasantness and character.
2) Compare C→D: starting from a generic short/medium isobutyrate (C) that is bright, fruity, sweet and fairly pleasant, the transformation to octyl (D) should follow the same pattern as A→B but be moderated because isobutyrate (smaller branched acid) is generally less pungent/unpleasant than larger branched acids. Thus octyl isobutyrate should retain fruity/sweet/edible qualities but in a milder, waxier, less top-note-intense form than short-chain isobutyrates.
3) Cross-check with other long-chain alkyl esters in the dataset (nonyl/hexyl/heptyl acetates, ethyl octanoate etc.): long alkyl chains often give moderate-to-high ""pleasant"" and fruity ratings when the acid/alkyl combination is naturally fruity; however branched/valerate-type acids can lower pleasantness. Octyl isobutyrate is expected to sit between very pleasant short isobutyrate esters (bright fruity, high edible/sweet) and the more muted octyl isovalerate example.
4) Translate these qualitative shifts into numerical predictions: low on fish/garlic/ammonia/decayed/burnt; moderate-low on spices/chemical/sweaty/musky; moderate strength (reduced relative to short volatile esters); moderate-high on pleasant/edible/fruit/sweet but not as high as small esters; familiarity moderate.

Predicted numeric ratings (0–100) are consistent with these structural-to-perceptual mappings.",54.0,12.0,52.0,58.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,22.0,8.0,3.0,12.0,24.0,15.0,6.0,20.0,14.0,18.0,9.0,28.0,10.0,30.0,50.0,38.0
isobutyl acetate,"Analogy: Butyl acetate is to isoamyl (isopentyl) acetate as isobutyl propionate is to isobutyl acetate. Reasoning steps: 
1) Choose a simple, well‑measured ester pair with a known perceptual shift when the alcohol/acyl part is changed (A:B). Butyl acetate (A; entry 150) is a straight‑chain C4 acetate with moderate strength and a fruity/pleasant profile; isoamyl (isopentyl) acetate (B; entry 151) is a branched C5 acetate that is typically fruitier/ sweeter and still pleasant. The A→B change (adding one extra carbon and branching on the alcohol side) increases “fruit/sweet” character and keeps pleasantness high. 
2) Choose a closely related compound C where we know percepts but it is on the other side of the same structural axis: isobutyl propionate (C; entry 294) is an isobutyl (branched C4 alcohol) ester with a propionyl (C3) acyl. Comparing propionate vs acetate homologs in the dataset shows acetates are generally more volatile and more intensely fruity/sweet than the corresponding propionates. 
3) Apply the same qualitative structural-to-odor mapping to predict D (isobutyl acetate): (a) branching on the alcohol side (isobutyl) tends to favor fruity/pear/banana-type estery notes, (b) switching from propionate→acetate typically increases volatility/fruitiness and often increases perceived strength/pleasantness, (c) compared with straight-chain butyl acetate the isobutyl branching gives similar or slightly more characteristic fruity/sweet nuance but comparable overall pleasantness. 
4) Calibrate numbers from neighbors: butyl acetate (strength ≈57, pleasant ≈58, familiar ≈57) and isoamyl acetate (fruitful/sweet, pleasant ≈52–63 in dataset) and isobutyl propionate (pleasant ≈54) guide us. Acetate status and branching push fruit/sweet/edible up; propionate→acetate pushes strength and fruitiness up relative to isobutyl propionate. Unpleasant notes (fish, garlic, ammonia, decayed, sweaty, musky) are low for small esters in the dataset. 
5) Final prediction for isobutyl acetate (D): a moderately strong, distinctly fruity/sweet acetate that is pleasant and fairly familiar, with negligible savory/offensive sulfur/amine/decay notes. Each numeric rating is an interpreted interpolation among butyl acetate (entry 150), isoamyl acetate (151), isobutyl propionate (294), and other small branched acetates (entries like 58 isopropyl acetate).",60.0,25.0,55.0,75.0,4.0,1.0,8.0,30.0,10.0,5.0,12.0,28.0,8.0,8.0,19.5,6.0,10.0,8.0,20.0,30.0,56.0,58.0,52.0
butyl butyrate,"Analogy and reasoning steps:
I used a structural-series interpolation analogy among butyrate esters. Specifically: Propyl butyrate (A) is to Amyl (pentyl) butyrate (B) as Butyl butyrate (C) is to D (predicted). Rationale: A and B differ only by the alcohol chain length (C3 vs C5) while the acid part is the same (butyrate). Increasing alcohol chain length in simple aliphatic esters typically (in this dataset) raises fruity/sweet/pleasant character up to a point and moderately alters perceived strength and ""off"" notes. Therefore butyl butyrate (C4) should fall roughly midway between propyl butyrate and amyl butyrate on most sensory dimensions.

I also cross-checked trends with related butyl esters (butyl acetate, butyl propionate, butyl formate) to make sure predictions for attributes such as strength, pleasantness and familiarity are consistent with the effect of changing the acid chain length when the alcohol is butyl. From those comparisons: butyl acetate and butyl propionate give similar magnitude strength/pleasantness values for butyl esters, and propyl->butyl->amyl interpolation yields moderate fruit and sweet ratings for butyl butyrate.

Concrete steps:
1) Extracted numeric values for propyl butyrate (A) and amyl butyrate (B) from the dataset. 
2) Averaged A and B values to estimate mid-chain (butyl) values for attributes present in the source (fish, cold, ammonia, decayed, strength, pleasant, familiar).
3) For attributes not explicitly provided for A and B (edible, bakery, sweet, fruit, garlic, spices, sour, burnt, acid, warm, musky, sweaty, wood, grass, flower, chemical) I assigned values consistent with typical aliphatic ester character (fruity, sweet, edible; low savory/sulfur/fish/garlic/spicy/burnt) and consistent with the interpolated pleasantness/strength/familiarity.
4) Final numbers were adjusted slightly to keep internal consistency (e.g., fruit and sweet above pleasant; fish/garlic/sweaty/musky low; strength similar to the interpolated value).

Hence the predicted profile represents an interpolation/consensus among closely related esters and known chain-length trends.",55.0,20.0,50.0,65.0,20.5,2.0,12.0,22.13,8.0,5.0,15.0,25.0,5.0,8.0,21.29,13.79,8.0,12.0,20.0,12.0,50.99,46.2,46.87
Butyl 10-undecenoate,"Analogy and reasoning steps:
A is Ethyl undecanoate (a long-chain saturated ethyl ester in the dataset) and B is Ethyl octanoate (a shorter, more volatile ethyl ester). C is Butyl 10‑undecenoate (the query) and D is Butyl octanoate (the butyl analogue with a shorter acid chain). 

Step 1 — Base-class mapping: Ethyl undecanoate vs ethyl octanoate illustrates how increasing acid chain length (longer alkyl in the acid portion) reduces volatility and fruitiness, often increases waxy/soapy or fatty/warm notes and slightly reduces perceived strength of the bright fruity/sweet facets. Use that as the A→B relationship (longer chain → lower fruity intensity, slightly warmer/waxy, moderate pleasantness).

Step 2 — Alcohol-chain effect: Replacing an ethyl alcohol moiety with a butyl one (ethyl→butyl) similarly reduces volatility and bright fruit impact and increases oily/waxy, warm/woody facets. Compare known butyl esters (e.g., butyl acetate, butyl butyrate) with their ethyl analogues: butyl versions are typically a touch less volatile, somewhat less sharply fruity but still pleasant and edible-smelling.

Step 3 — Unsaturation effect: The 10‑undecenoate has a terminal (near-omega) double bond vs a fully saturated acid (undecanoate). Terminal unsaturation often adds a faint green/vegetal or slightly balsamic nuance and can slightly boost “grass/green” or floral edge without adding harsh off-notes.

Combine effects: A (ethyl undecanoate) → B (ethyl octanoate) shows how chain-shortening increases fruitiness and volatility. Applying the same chain-length/volatility relation within the butyl series (C → D) means Butyl 10‑undecenoate should be less volatile and slightly less intensely fruity than a butyl ester of a shorter acid, but it will retain clear ester/fruity-sweet, edible character and be viewed as pleasant and moderately familiar. The butyl alcohol tail and the long acid chain push perception towards warmer, waxy/woody and somewhat fatty notes; the terminal double bond adds a small green/grass/flower nuance.

Predictions follow these directional adjustments from dataset analogues (e.g., Ethyl undecanoate, Ethyl octanoate, Butyl butyrate, other long-chain esters) to yield numeric ratings.",66.0,26.0,56.0,62.0,4.0,1.0,8.0,18.0,10.0,3.0,15.0,34.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,26.0,24.0,28.0,12.0,34.0,59.0,46.0
valeric acid,"Analogy used to predict valeric acid (pentanoic acid) scent: Butyric acid (C4) is to Caproic acid (C6) as Valeric acid (C5) is to the midpoint (straight-chain C5) between them. Reasoning steps: 1) Both butyric (C4) and caproic (C6) are straight-chain volatile fatty acids whose sensory profiles (high pungency, rancid/cheesy/sweaty notes, acidic/sour perception) change gradually with carbon chain length. 2) Observed data: butyric acid (C4) shows very high strength/pungency and strong “acid” character; caproic acid (C6) is slightly less pungent but still strongly acidic and unpleasant. 3) Isovaleric acid (branched C5) is known to be somewhat less intense and more malodorous in a “cheesy” way than the straight chain analog; branching lowers volatility and can reduce perceived strength. 4) Therefore, straight-chain valeric acid (C5) should lie between butyric and caproic in most dimensions: slightly less intense than butyric, slightly more intense than caproic for some descriptors, with pronounced acidic/sour, sweaty/cheesy, and decayed notes. 5) I interpolated key quantitative descriptors (fish, cold, ammonia, decayed, strength, pleasant, familiar) from C4 and C6 values and adjusted sweaty/acid/sour upward to reflect known fatty-acid character; other semantic dimensions (edible, bakery, sweet, fruit, flower, wood, grass, musky, garlic, spices, burnt) were set near low baseline values consistent with rancid/acid profiles. Final predictions reflect the analogy: valeric acid = midpoint/straight-chain C5 behavior between butyric and caproic acids, with high acid/sour, notable sweaty/decayed character, strong overall intensity, and low pleasant/food-like attributes.",10.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,24.6,5.0,10.0,24.3,70.0,6.0,78.0,35.0,10.0,65.0,30.4,33.6,6.0,10.0,5.0,30.0,78.8,17.7,48.8
propyl acetate,"Analogy used: Methyl acetate is to ethyl acetate as ethyl acetate is to propyl acetate.
Reasoning steps:
1) Identify a homologous series (alkyl acetates). Methyl → ethyl → propyl represent successive +CH2 steps. Sensory changes across such a homologous series are reasonably systematic: increasing alkyl chain length tends to increase fruity/ripe/round notes and perceived sweetness and overall pleasantness/familiarity (more ‘‘full’’ fruity character), while reducing the sharp, volatile, solvent-like (‘‘chemical/cold/solvent’’) impression. Odor strength and volatility can shift nonlinearly with chain length, but for small esters propyl acetate is typically slightly less volatile than ethyl acetate and often perceived as moderately strong and quite fruity/pleasant.
2) Observe example numeric changes (noisy) between methyl acetate and ethyl acetate in the provided data (e.g., pleasant rises, cold/solvent character can change). Because the dataset contains experimental variability, I apply a smoothed chemical rationale rather than a direct noisy delta on every field.
3) Apply the smoothed pattern to ethyl acetate to predict propyl acetate: increase fruit and sweet, increase pleasant/familiar moderately, lower sharp/chemical/ammonia/solvent attributes, keep very low values for off-notes (garlic, sweaty, musky, burnt, fish), and set moderate odor strength (propyl acetate is perceptible but less piercing than ethyl acetate's sharp solvent edge).
4) Resulting numeric predictions reflect this homologous extrapolation and domain knowledge of ester odor quality (fruity, sweet, pleasantly solvent-like but not putrid): propyl acetate is predicted as strongly fruity and moderately sweet, pleasant and familiar, with low unpleasant/off-note ratings.",60.0,40.0,60.0,78.0,10.0,2.0,8.0,30.0,10.0,2.0,12.0,20.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,12.0,5.0,10.0,20.0,30.0,52.0,60.0,50.0
Butylamine,"Analogy: Isobutylamine (A) is to its measured scent profile (B) as butylamine (C) is to the predicted scent profile (D). Reasoning steps: 1) Structural analogy: A and C are both primary aliphatic amines with four-carbon scaffolds; the only systematic difference is branching (isobutylamine is branched, butylamine is linear). 2) How structure maps to odor: branching often reduces volatility and can mute or alter certain receptor interactions; linear primary amines tend to present a somewhat sharper, more ammonia-/fish-like, and often more intense odor. 3) Starting point: use isobutylamine's known ratings as the baseline (fishy/ammoniacal, moderate strength, moderately unfamiliar/unpleasant). 4) Apply structural adjustments: linear butylamine is expected to be a little more fishy and more ammoniacal, somewhat stronger in intensity, a bit less pleasant and slightly more 'decayed'/'sweaty' character, while remaining low on fruity/bakery/flower/wood/woody notes. 5) Quantitative changes applied from A->C baseline: fish +~5, ammonia +~25 (reflecting linear amine's stronger ammoniacal perception vs branched example), strength +~15, pleasant -~12, decayed +~6, sweaty +~10; edible/bakery/sweet/fruit/flower/wood/grass set near zero to low because aliphatic amines are not perceived as edible/fruity/bakery/flowery. 6) Resulting D is a numeric scent profile consistent with chemical/olfactory knowledge and scaled to the 0–100 ratings in the provided dataset.",8.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,48.0,8.0,10.0,22.0,18.0,6.0,12.0,15.0,6.0,35.0,50.0,30.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,65.0,50.0,25.0,40.0
Ethyl formate,"Hexyl formate is to Butyl formate as Butyl formate is to Ethyl formate (D). Reasoning steps: 1) Choose formate esters of decreasing alkyl chain length (hexyl -> butyl -> ethyl) to capture consistent trends in volatility, fruitiness and ""solvent/chemical"" character. 2) Observe measured properties: Hexyl formate (longer chain) shows relatively lower volatility-like markers (lower 'fish' and 'cold') and moderately high strength/chemical character; Butyl formate (mid chain) is somewhat more volatile/solvent-like, with slightly higher 'fish' and 'cold' and similar pleasantness. 3) Moving another step down the chain to Ethyl formate (short chain) we expect: higher volatility, brighter/sweeter and more pronounced fruity top notes, somewhat stronger perceived chemical/solvent character, and moderate-to-high overall strength, but still judged pleasant and familiar because small alkyl formates are common fruity esters. 4) Quantitative interpolation/extrapolation strategy: take the mid-chain (butyl) as anchor and shift attributes toward increased volatility/fruitiness and chemical/sharp character versus hexyl by an amount comparable to the hexyl→butyl difference (adjusted for further shortening). For hedonic metrics (pleasant, familiar) esters typically stay moderately pleasant; shorten-ing often raises intensity but not proportionally reduces pleasantness. 5) Apply these directional shifts to generate numeric predictions for Ethyl formate (D). Notes: where dataset shows inconsistent trends across unrelated esters, priority was given to nearest structural analogues (formates) and known olfactory descriptions (ethyl formate = sharp, fruity, pineapple/rum-like, fairly solventy).",70.0,20.0,65.0,82.0,12.0,3.0,8.0,26.0,22.0,3.0,18.0,12.0,4.0,4.0,25.0,14.0,5.0,10.0,18.0,55.0,55.0,62.0,58.0
Thiophene,"Analogy: A is to B as C is to D

Elements of the analogy
- A = 2-acetylthiophene (a substituted thiophene in the dataset). Its measured profile: moderate fish/rotten cues, moderate chemical strength, reasonably familiar and moderately pleasant (strength ~36.7, pleasant ~48.5, familiar ~43.4). A is a thiophene ring carrying an electron‑withdrawing acetyl group; that substitution raises molecular weight, adds carbonyl-driven cooked/roasted/bready facets and generally pushes the odor toward more ‘‘food‑like’’/ketone notes compared with the bare heterocycle.
- B = 3‑acetyl‑2,5‑dimethylthiophene (another substituted thiophene in the dataset). Its profile shows higher overall intensity and somewhat different hedonic balance (strength ~56.2, pleasant ~36.0). Comparing A→B shows that alkylation (adding methyls) plus an acetyl increases perceived strength and shifts the character (often more roasted/meatlike/strong) while not necessarily increasing ‘‘fruity/bakery’’ edible ratings.

Mapping to the unknown
- C = 2‑acetylthiophene (the known substituted thiophene used as A above).
- D = Thiophene (the query). By the same structural relationship: removing the acetyl (and removing alkyl groups) reduces molecular weight and removes the carbonyl/ketone contributions that add bakery/roasted/pleasant cues, leaving the unsubstituted heteroaromatic sulfur ring. Sulfur in a small aromatic ring tends to give more ‘‘chemical/petroleum/sulfurous’’ and less fruity/bakery/edible character than oxygen analogs (furans) or acetylated derivatives. From the dataset we see unsubstituted small heterocycles (e.g., small furans/pyrazines/pyrroles) tend to have moderate chemical/strength ratings, modest pleasantness, and modest familiarity. Thiophene should therefore be: moderately intense (but typically less intense than heavily alkylated/acetylated thiophenes), noticeably chemical/petroleum/sulfurous, low on edible/bakery/sweet/fruit, low–moderate on fish/decay (it’s not the strongly rotten sulfur of mercaptans but has an inorganic/chemical note), and moderately familiar to trained noses (it appears in petroleum/gasoline and some roasted notes).

Stepwise reasoning used to pick numeric values
1) Base intensity: substituted thiophenes in the table show strengths ~36–69; small unsubstituted aromatics in the table (e.g., furan, pyrrole analogs, benzene-like small aromatics) tend to cluster around 20–55. I place thiophene near the middle: strength ~50 (noticeable but not extreme).
2) Hedonics/pleasant: removal of acetyl tends to reduce bakery/pleasant cues; sulfurous ring tends to be less pleasant than many odorants. Assign pleasant ~30 (mildly unpleasant/neutral).
3) Chemical score: sulfurous aromatic ring shows a clear chemical/petroleum character; many thiophene/thiol/thioketone entries have chemical scores high (e.g., 2‑acetylthiophene/3‑acetyl thiophenes). Assign chemical ~65.
4) Edible/bakery/sweet/fruit: low (thiophene is not a fruity or bakery note); values near 4–6.
5) Fish/garlic/decayed: low to moderate. Thiophene is not a thiol (those give extremely high rotten/fishy scores) but has some savory/petroleum edge; fish ~10, decayed ~15, garlic ~8.
6) Other perceptual axes (spices, warm, wood, grass, flower, musky, sweaty, ammonia, cold, sour, burnt, acid): derived by analogy to small heterocycles and nearby thiophene derivatives — mostly low to moderate values (10–25) with cold ~22 and warm ~18 to reflect the volatility and slightly sharp character.
7) Familiar: thiophene is a recognizable, commonly encountered industrial/petroleum descriptor for chemists and perfumers, but not highly ‘‘popular’’ in edible/floral contexts. Assign familiar ~35.

Predicted profile (numerical justification is the mapping above from substituted→unsubstituted thiophenes and from oxygen analogs to sulfur analogs):
- strength moderate (noticeable), chemical high (petroleum/sulfurous), pleasant low–moderate, edible/bakery/sweet/fruit low, fish/decay low–moderate, familiarity modest.",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,8.0,12.0,22.0,5.0,8.0,5.0,18.0,8.0,6.0,10.0,15.0,10.0,8.0,4.0,65.0,50.0,30.0,35.0
Succinic acid,"Fumaric acid is to adipic acid as succinic acid is to D. Reasoning steps: 1) Identify A and B: fumaric acid (A) and adipic acid (B) are both dicarboxylic acids in the dataset; fumaric is smaller/unsaturated and adipic is longer/saturated. Their scent ratings show fumaric with relatively lower ""decayed"" and moderate ""strength"" and adipic with somewhat higher ""decayed"" but lower ""strength"" in some dimensions. 2) Place C: succinic acid (C) is the saturated four‑carbon dicarboxylic acid between fumaric (C4 but unsaturated) and adipic (C6 saturated) in carbon chain and volatility. Volatility and perceived sourness tend to increase with lower MW and higher polarity, while longer chains often give heavier, more ""decayed"" or fatty notes. 3) Predict D by interpolation and by comparing other acids: succinic should be more volatile/acidic than adipic but somewhat similar to fumaric in acid/sour character; it will be less pleasant and less fruity than esters (e.g., dimethyl/diethyl succinate) and more sour/acidic than single carboxylic acids like acetic in some dimensions because it is a dicarboxylic acid but less intensely vinegary than acetic. 4) Adjust for known odor character: succinic acid is commonly described as sour/tart, slightly acidic/cheesy or sweaty at higher concentrations and present in foods (so somewhat food‑related/familiar). Therefore the predicted profile is: moderate strength, high acid/sour ratings, modest ""chemical/decayed/sweaty"" notes, low floral/fruit/bakery/sweet scores, and moderate familiarity. These judgments produce the numeric predictions below.",45.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,20.0,5.0,10.0,28.0,65.0,5.0,70.0,12.0,12.0,28.0,20.0,30.0,6.0,8.0,5.0,40.0,36.0,34.0,44.0
Fumaric acid,"Analogy used and reasoning steps:
A (Succinic acid) is to B (its measured olfactory profile) as C (Fumaric acid) is to D (predicted olfactory profile).
Reasoning steps: 
1) Structural analogy: Succinic acid (HOOC–CH2–CH2–COOH) and fumaric acid (HOOC–CH=CH–COOH) are both dicarboxylic acids of similar molecular weight and polarity. They differ mainly by the C=C unsaturation in fumaric acid. Because both are low‑volatility crystalline acids, their odor profiles tend to be weak, dominated by acidic/chemical notes rather than fruity/floral/pleasant volatiles.
2) Volatility and perceptual consequences: The C=C in fumaric acid slightly increases rigidity and typically reduces vapor pressure compared with small monoacids; fumaric acid is empirically known to be very low in odor (practically odorless) compared with many small carboxylic acids. From the analogy to succinic (moderate ‘strength’ in the dataset) we therefore scale down strength and most high‑intensity attributes for fumaric acid.
3) Acidic/chemical character: Both dicarboxylic acids register as having “acid”/“sour” and “chemical” character in perception. Fumaric will retain a moderate acid/chemical quality (odor evokes acidic/chemical sensations) but at lower intensity because of low volatility.
4) Hedonic/familiar attributes: Compared to more volatile edible or fruity esters/acids, fumaric is less evocative of edible/bakery/sweet/fruit attributes and will be rated modest to low on pleasantness and familiarity. Use citric and tartaric as additional analogs for edible/acid balance (they show moderate pleasant despite acidity), but fumaric is less familiar/pleasant than those because it’s less commonly encountered as an odorant.
5) Specific low‑level notes: Fish/garlic/sweaty/musky/wood/flower/grass/burnt notes are predicted to be low because fumaric lacks sulfur, phenolic or long alkyl groups that give those qualities.
Summary: Starting from succinic/adipic/citric/tartaric analogs, reduce overall intensity (strength) because fumaric is less volatile; keep moderate acid/chemical/sour character; set low values for fruity, floral, sulfurous, and “pleasant” hedonic extremes.
Predicted numeric ratings are given below (0–100 scale).",30.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,15.0,5.0,6.0,15.0,35.0,2.0,45.0,10.0,5.0,5.0,18.0,12.0,5.0,8.0,4.0,40.0,12.0,30.0,25.0
Isopropyl myristate,"Analogy: Ethyl myristate (A) is to its measured odor profile (B) as isopropyl myristate (C) is to the predicted odor profile (D).

Reasoning steps using the analogy:
1) Identify a close structural analogue with measured data: ethyl myristate is the same myristic acid esterified with a small ethyl group. Its dataset profile shows a mild, low‑volatility, fatty/neutral ester character (moderate pleasantness, modest strength). This is A→B.
2) Map the chemical change: replacing the ethyl group (–CH2CH3) with an isopropyl group (–CH(CH3)2) increases steric bulk, branching and molecular weight, and reduces volatility and vapor pressure. This parallels the simpler analogy: ethanol → isopropanol; the branched isopropyl substituent lowers volatility and often reduces odor intensity / increases odor threshold.
3) Predict how those physical-chemical changes affect sensory attributes: lower volatility → lower overall odor strength and fewer high‑pitched volatile notes (fruit, sharp acid, sour, ammonia) and relatively more very faint fatty/soapy, waxy, slightly musky base impressions. Branching can also slightly mute ester “sweet/fruity” facets and make the odor more neutral/skin-like (cosmetic oil). Unpleasant notes (sulfur, sweaty, decayed, fish, garlic) should remain very low because the molecule lacks heteroatoms or small volatile fragments that generate those notes.
4) Translate qualitative expectations into numeric ratings (0–100): start from ethyl myristate’s profile and reduce intensity/volatile-associated attributes, keep or slightly lower pleasant/familiar because the material is used topically and is largely odorless to mildly neutral; assign low values to harsh/unpleasant categories and slightly elevated for warm/musky/chemical (waxy) descriptors appropriate for a long‑chain, low‑volatility ester.

Predicted profile summary (isopropyl myristate): a very low‑strength, mildly pleasant, neutral fatty/waxy oil note with small musky/warm character and minimal volatile/acidic/sulfurous attributes.",20.0,8.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,12.0,5.0,1.0,8.0,28.0,22.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,5.0,18.0,10.0,42.0,35.0
Ethyl decanoate,"Analogy and reasoning steps:
A (ethyl hexanoate) is to B (ethyl octanoate) as C (ethyl octanoate) is to D (ethyl decanoate).
1) Rationale for the analogy: these three molecules are the same functional group (ethyl esters) differing only by the length of the aliphatic acid chain (C6, C8, C10). Comparing how perceptual ratings change from ethyl hexanoate -> ethyl octanoate reveals the chain‑length trend to extrapolate from ethyl octanoate -> ethyl decanoate.
2) Observed trend (from the dataset): going from shorter to longer ester chains tends to reduce volatility and the intensity of bright fruity/sweet top notes, moving the odor slightly toward a fatter/waxier, less volatile profile. Ammonia, garlic, and fishy attributes remain low for these esters. Overall pleasantness often stays moderately high but can decline a bit with increasing chain length; strength (overall intensity) stays in the moderate range.
3) Application to the query: ethyl octanoate (C8) has a known profile (fruity, sweet, pleasant, moderate strength). By extrapolating the same incremental change seen from C6->C8 to C8->C10, ethyl decanoate (C10) is predicted to be slightly less fruity/sweet and a touch less volatile/bright, a bit more waxy/fatty, but still clearly fruity and overall pleasant.
4) Quantitative extrapolation approach: start from ethyl octanoate dataset values and reduce fruit/sweet/pleasant modestly (~5–10 points), keep ammonia/garlic/fish very low, keep strength around the same moderate level, and slightly increase waxy/fatty/acidic/woody nuance values relative to the shorter ester.
Predictions (0–100):
- edible: 68  (still perceived as food‑like/edible fruity ester)
- bakery: 30  (not strongly bready; minor sweet/bakery impression)
- sweet: 60  (sweet/fruity but somewhat attenuated vs shorter esters)
- fruit: 68  (fruity apple/pear/pineapple character, slightly lower than C8)
- fish: 20  (low to moderate; esters are not fishy)
- garlic: 1  (negligible)
- spices: 10  (low)
- cold: 19  (cool/freshness low to moderate; similar to ethyl octanoate)
- sour: 15  (low sourness)
- burnt: 5  (very low)
- acid: 20  (mild acidity/acidic ester nuance)
- warm: 42  (neutral‑warm, slightly more viscous/waxy impression)
- musky: 5  (very low)
- sweaty: 5  (very low)
- ammonia: 1.2  (very low; esters typically score near zero)
- decayed: 12.5  (low; esters usually not decayed)
- wood: 15  (slight fatty/waxy woody impression with longer chain)
- grass: 10  (low)
- flower: 25  (some floral facets but subordinate to fruit)
- chemical: 20  (some synthetic/chemical ester note but not dominant)
- strength: 50  (moderate overall intensity)
- pleasant: 62  (still pleasant, slightly less than shorter, brighter esters)
- familiar: 52  (moderately familiar; common food/fruity ester)

Notes: these values are extrapolations guided by nearest homologues (ethyl hexanoate, ethyl heptanoate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl undecanoate) and known olfactory trends for increasing alkyl chain length in simple ethyl esters (less volatile, slightly more fatty/waxy, mild reduction in bright fruity/sweet intensity). Actual perception can vary with concentration and matrix effects.",68.0,30.0,60.0,68.0,20.0,1.0,10.0,19.0,15.0,5.0,20.0,42.0,5.0,5.0,1.2,12.5,15.0,10.0,25.0,20.0,50.0,62.0,52.0
Diethyl sebacate,"Analogy used: Ethyl decanoate (a single, long-chain ethyl ester) is to its scent profile (fruity/fatty, mild, moderately pleasant, low volatility/low strength) as Diethyl sebacate (a long-chain diester of similar overall carbon count but with two ester termini) is to its expected scent profile. Reasoning steps: 1) Ethyl decanoate (dataset example) is a long mono-ester with reported low strength and a mildly pleasant, fatty-fruity character; diesters with short backbones (e.g., diethyl succinate, diethyl malonate) tend to be low in harsh off-notes (fish, ammonia, garlic) and show modest ""edible/pleasant"" impressions but vary in volatility. 2) Diethyl sebacate has a long, flexible C8 alkyl spacer between two ethyl ester groups (higher molar mass and lower volatility than small esters), so it will be less volatile and lower in perceived strength than smaller fruity esters, and likely more waxy/fatty and slightly musky/waxy in impression. 3) Compared to monoesters of similar chain length (ethyl decanoate) we expect similar fatty/waxy and mildly fruity notes but somewhat weaker top-note fruitiness and somewhat enhanced waxy/musky and oily impressions due to the diester nature and lower volatility. 4) Diethyl sebacate should therefore score very low on fish/garlic/ammonia/decayed/burnt, low-to-moderate on sour/acidic, low on spices/chemical/sharp aspects, and modest-to-moderate on edible/pleasant/familiar owing to a generally mild, inoffensive, slightly fatty/fruity aroma. Numerical predictions (0-100) follow these qualitative expectations and are anchored by dataset analogs (ethyl decanoate, diethyl succinate, ethyl stearate, diethyl malonate).",40.0,25.0,30.0,30.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,20.0,10.0,2.0,12.0,25.0,30.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,20.0,10.0,20.0,10.0,12.0,48.0,35.0
2-heptanone,"Analogy: 2-hexanone (A) is to its measured scent profile (B) as 2-heptanone (C) is to the predicted scent profile (D). Reasoning steps: 1) Structural analogy: 2-heptanone (C) differs from 2-hexanone (A) by one extra CH2 (longer linear alkyl chain) while retaining the same 2-ketone functional group; odor changes with added chain length are typically gradual. 2) Empirical anchor: use 2-hexanone (measured) as primary anchor and also consider nearby ketones in the dataset (3-octanone, 2-nonanone, 4-heptanone) to estimate trends (chain length tends to: slightly increase sweetness/roundness/pleasantness, modestly decrease volatility-related ""cold"" and pungent notes, maintain moderate ketone/chemical character and similar strength). 3) Adjustments made: increase ""edible/sweet/pleasant/familiar"" mildly relative to 2-hexanone; keep ""fish/garlic/sweaty/ammonia/decayed"" low-to-moderate similar to 2-hexanone; set ""chemical"" and ""strength"" in the mid-high range typical for small aliphatic ketones. 4) Numeric predictions are rounded to sensible values (0–100) consistent with neighboring ketones. Predicted values below are the result of that analogy and the small, systematic adjustments described.",45.0,20.0,40.0,30.0,6.0,5.0,12.0,24.0,10.0,8.0,12.0,30.0,8.0,6.0,28.0,22.0,10.0,15.0,20.0,50.0,54.0,48.0,50.0
valeraldehyde,"A is to B as C is to D:
Butyraldehyde (A, a C4 aliphatic aldehyde) is to Hexanal (B, a C6 aliphatic aldehyde) as Valeraldehyde / pentanal (C, a C5 aliphatic aldehyde) is to D (the predicted perceptual profile). Reasoning: chain length in straight-chain saturated aldehydes steadily affects volatility, pungency, and green/grassiness in a roughly monotonic way. Moving from C4 -> C6, intensity (strength) tends to decrease slightly while green/grass notes and ‘‘fatty’’ character increase; pleasantness shifts modestly. Therefore valeraldehyde (C5) should lie approximately midway between butyraldehyde and hexanal for quantitative attributes. I computed midpoints for the directly comparable numeric attributes (fish, cold, ammonia, decayed, strength, pleasant, familiar) and adjusted other semantic attributes using known qualitative behavior of short aliphatic aldehydes: they are generally pungent/chemical, somewhat unpleasant (low edible/bakery/sweet), have noticeable green/grass/fatty character, moderate ‘‘chemical’’ note, low floral/woody/musky character. Final numeric estimates reflect linear interpolation for the measured aldehyde attributes plus chemically informed adjustments for other scent dimensions.",12.0,6.0,10.0,11.0,24.5,5.0,9.0,21.6,11.0,5.0,15.0,20.0,4.0,14.0,24.0,29.2,9.0,30.0,5.0,62.0,64.9,26.0,37.3
Diethyl disulfide,"Analogy used to reach the predictions:

A is to B as C is to D

Where:
- A = Diethyl sulfide (single‑sulfur, CCSSC in the dataset) with known perceptual profile (moderate strength, noticeable sulfuric/fishy/decayed notes, moderate unpleasantness).
- B = Diethyl disulfide (the query).
- C = Dipropyl disulfide / other small aliphatic disulfides (dataset examples: dipropyl disulfide, benzyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide) which are structurally similar to diethyl sulfide but contain an extra sulfur or are disulfides.
- D = predicted perceptual profile for diethyl disulfide.

Reasoning steps (how the analogy was applied):
1. Structural analogy: Diethyl disulfide is the +S analogue of diethyl sulfide (it has an S–S bond rather than a single thioether). In the dataset, changing from a sulfide to a disulfide or adding extra sulfur generally increases odor strength and accentuates alliaceous/garlic/onion/decayed characteristics while often reducing perceived pleasantness.
2. Empirical anchors: Diethyl sulfide (dataset entry) shows moderate strength (~49) and moderate scores on fish/ammonia/decayed. Other disulfides in the dataset (dipropyl disulfide, benzyl/bis(aryl) disulfides, dimethyl trisulfide) typically show higher strength (~65–75), higher alliaceous/decayed/chemical character and lower pleasantness. These form the C→D part of the analogy: going from a sulfide to a disulfide tends to scale up intensity and “garlic/decay” attributes.
3. Scaling and attribute-specific adjustments: Starting from the diethyl‑sulfide anchor, I increased strength substantially (to match disulfide magnitudes), raised garlic and decayed/chemical/fishy character, left floral/fruit/bakery/sweet/wood/grass/musky attributes very low (these are not typical for small aliphatic disulfides), and reduced pleasantness. Ammonia and sweaty impressions are set moderately high because short sulfur volatiles often evince pungent, body‑like/offensive notes. Familiarity is moderate (these are common odorants in food/biogenic degradation and thus somewhat recognizable).
4. Cross‑checking with similar entries: I compared to dipropyl disulfide, benzyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide to ensure predicted strength, decayed and garlic values fall into a consistent range with those disulfides while still reflecting the slightly smaller/volatile diethyl disulfide.

Predicted adjustments therefore reflect: increased intensity and alliaceous/decay/chemical character relative to the sulfide, low fruit/floral/bakery/sweet, moderate fish/ammonia/sweaty, reduced pleasantness.

Cyclohexane,"Analogy: Octane (A) is to its sensory profile (B) as Cyclohexane (C) is to the predicted profile (D).

Reasoning steps: 
1) Choice of A: Octane is a straight-chain hydrocarbon with a simple, solvent/gasoline-like odor and is a good baseline for nonpolar hydrocarbons. Cyclohexane is also a simple hydrocarbon (nonpolar) but is cyclic. Both lack polar/functional groups that produce fruity, sweet, or strongly floral notes. Therefore octane's profile is an appropriate starting point.
2) Adjustments from A to D based on structure: Cyclohexane is slightly less volatile and often reported as a milder, somewhat solvent-like/cycloalkane odor compared with many straight-chain alkanes. It lacks carbonyls, sulfurs, or aromatic substituents that increase pungency or specific notes (e.g., sweet, floral, sulfurous). Compared with carbonyl-bearing cyclohexanone, cyclohexane will be less strong, less sweet/ketonic, and more purely 'chemical/solvent'.
3) Attribute-specific mapping rules applied:
   - All food-related facets (edible, bakery, sweet, fruit) lowered to near-zero because hydrocarbons are not perceived as foodlike.
   - Sulfurous/fishy/garlic/sweaty/ammonia/decayed dimensions set low because cyclohexane lacks heteroatoms that generate those notes.
   - ""Chemical/solvent"" character increased to high because nonpolar hydrocarbons are classified as chemical/solvent-like.
   - ""Strength"" reduced moderately relative to octane (an observed solvent with modest strength) because cyclohexane tends to be milder; I applied about a 20–30% downward adjustment from typical straight-alkane strength values.
   - ""Pleasant"" set modestly below neutral (mid-scale) because cyclohexane is neither strongly pleasant nor strongly unpleasant; many simple solvents are rated moderately neutral to slightly unpleasant.
   - ""Familiar"" set moderate-to-high because pure hydrocarbon solvent smells are commonly encountered (fuels, lab solvents, industrial products).
   - Minor green/woody/grass/flower notes set very low because cyclohexane has essentially no botanical character.

These steps produced the numeric predictions below for Cyclohexane (D).",5.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,25.0,3.0,8.0,4.0,15.0,6.0,5.0,8.0,8.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,65.0,36.0,42.0,45.0
pyridine,"Analogy and reasoning:
I reason by analogy to chemically similar N-heterocycles in the dataset. Quinoline (a benz‑fused pyridine) and piperidine (a saturated C5N amine) provide instructive reference points: Quinoline (large, aromatic, basic N) scores high on overall strength and a strong ""chemical/unpleasant"" character (strength ~70, chemical/harsh descriptors high, unpleasant/low pleasant), while piperidine (aliphatic, basic amine) scores high on ammonia/amine and decayed/fishy notes. Unsubstituted pyridine is structurally between these: it is a small, basic aromatic heterocycle (like quinoline at the core) but without benzo‑fusion or large substituents, so it is typically strongly penetrating, pungent, and amine/ammonia‑like (more ammonia/chemical than quinoline), somewhat fishy/solventlike, and generally unpleasant. Therefore: Quinoline : (high strength, high chemical/unpleasant) :: Pyridine : (high strength but with relatively higher ammonia/fishy character and low pleasantness). Using values of close analogues (piperidine, quinoline, substituted pyridines) and shifting toward stronger ammonia/chemical and lower pleasant/bakery/fruit ratings yields the predictions below.",5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,28.0,8.0,10.0,30.0,20.0,10.0,15.0,20.0,15.0,25.0,45.0,35.0,10.0,8.0,5.0,70.0,68.0,20.0,48.0
Piperidine,"Pyrrolidine is to its measured odor profile as Piperidine is to the predicted odor profile. Reasoning steps: 1) Identify the structural analogy: pyrrolidine (C4NH cyclic secondary amine, 5‑membered ring) and piperidine (C5NH cyclic secondary amine, 6‑membered ring) are closely related: same functional group (secondary aliphatic amine), one carbon longer ring. 2) Use nearby dataset analogs for trends: pyrrolidine (entry 149) shows a moderately fishy/ammoniacal character with modest intensity; open‑chain aliphatic amines in the set (butylamine, isoamylamine) tend to show higher ammonia/fishy notes and sometimes greater overall pungency. 3) Chemical rationale: piperidine is a basic, volatile aliphatic amine with strong amine/ammonia character; increasing ring size from 5→6 slightly changes volatility but preserves and often increases the characteristic amine/pungent notes compared with smaller cyclic amines. 4) Sensory inference: therefore piperidine should retain the same qualitative descriptors (amine/ammoniacal, fishy, sweaty, chemical/unpleasant) but with somewhat higher ammonia and overall strength and somewhat lower pleasantness than pyrrolidine. 5) Quantitative interpolation: I used pyrrolidine's measured values as baseline for fish/ammonia/strength/pleasant/familiar and biased those toward the higher ammonia/pungency seen in open‑chain small amines to produce the final numeric predictions below.",5.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,40.0,5.0,8.0,20.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,15.0,15.0,55.0,60.0,35.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,70.0,60.0,20.0,35.0
6-Methyl-5-hepten-2-one,"Analogy and reasoning steps:

A is to B as C is to D

A = 5-methyl-2-hepten-4-one (a branched, unsaturated aliphatic ketone in the dataset)
B = the measured scent profile of 5-methyl-2-hepten-4-one (strength ≈52.1, pleasant ≈53.0, familiar ≈43.4, very low 'fish', moderate 'cold' and 'ammonia', low 'decayed')
C = 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (the query; a structural isomer: same functional group—an unsaturated methylated ketone—very similar molecular weight and overall volatility)
D = predicted scent profile for 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one

Reasoning: 5-methyl-2-hepten-4-one (A) and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (C) are closely related: both are small-to-medium aliphatic unsaturated ketones with a single methyl branch and one C=C. Isomerization (shift of the double bond and methyl) typically produces small quantitative shifts in perceived qualities rather than wholesale changes of odor class. Thus the appropriate analogy is that the perceptual profile of C (the query) will be similar to B (the known profile of A) with modest, chemically plausible adjustments: isomerization placing the carbonyl and double bond in different positions can make the odor slightly fruitier/warmer and a touch more “pleasant” (common for MHO-type ketones used in fruity/floral top notes) while keeping overall strength similar and keeping low ‘fish’/‘garlic’/‘decayed’ character. I therefore start from B’s values and nudge them according to typical effects of moving unsaturation/methyl location: increase fruit/pleasant/flower/warmth slightly; keep low off-notes (fish, garlic, decayed); leave strength and familiarity near the analog.

Predictions follow these adjustment steps applied to the analog profile, yielding the numbers below.",48.0,12.0,42.0,62.0,2.0,5.0,18.0,24.0,12.0,8.0,10.0,36.0,12.0,10.0,22.0,15.0,8.0,20.0,35.0,28.0,50.0,54.0,45.0
Methyl caprylate,"Analogy (used to derive predictions):
A is to B as C is to D:
A = methyl caproate (methyl hexanoate) — known profile: fruity, moderately pleasant, moderate intensity.
B = its measured ratings (baseline esters of short/medium chain length).
C = methyl nonanoate and ethyl octanoate — measured profiles for longer-chain esters (C9 and ethyl C8 analog) that show how increasing chain length shifts odor character (tends to become slightly less sharp, often fruitier/softer, similar or slightly higher pleasantness, moderate intensity).
D = methyl caprylate (methyl octanoate) — the query.
Reasoning steps:
1) Identify chemical family and homolog trend: methyl caprylate is a straight-chain saturated alkyl ester (methyl octanoate). In this dataset, methyl esters (methyl caproate C6, methyl heptanoate C7, methyl nonanoate C9) and ethyl/propyl esters show consistent patterns: esters are fruity/sweet, with pleasantness often moderate-high and intensity in the moderate range. Increasing alkyl chain length tends to reduce sharp, solvent-like notes and can make the odor fuller, sometimes slightly more fatty/less volatile but still fruity.
2) Use nearby homologues to interpolate: methyl caproate (C6) has pleasant ≈54.6 and strength ≈54.3; methyl nonanoate (C9) has pleasant ≈57.8 and strength ≈45.7; ethyl octanoate (ethyl C8) has pleasant ≈64.4 and strength ≈51.3. The pattern suggests methyl C8 (methyl caprylate) will be fruity/sweet, pleasant in the high 50s–low 60s, and intensity around 45–52.
3) Map homolog trends to attribute axes: ""fruit"" and ""sweet"" should be high; ""edible"" (used in flavor) should be high; unpleasant notes (fish, garlic, sweaty, ammonia, decayed, burnt) should be low; floral/woody facets are modest; ""familiar"" medium-high because common ester in flavors/perfumes.
4) Choose numeric interpolation consistent with examples: assign methyl caprylate slightly more fruity/sweet than methyl caproate and methyl heptanoate, similar pleasantness to methyl nonanoate but a bit lower than ethyl octanoate, moderate intensity roughly 50.
Conclusion: D (methyl caprylate) predicted profile (numbers 0–100) follows from interpolating the homologous ester series and comparing to ethyl C8 analogue.",60.0,10.0,60.0,68.0,6.0,1.0,8.0,20.0,8.0,4.0,12.0,28.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,12.0,9.0,22.0,10.0,50.0,60.0,52.0
2-octanone,"Analogy (used to derive the predictions):

A is to B as C is to D
A = 2‑heptanone (known data) ; B = 2‑nonanone (known data)
C = 3‑octanone (known data) ; D = 2‑octanone (query)

Reasoning steps:
1) Choose A and B as a pair of 2‑ketones that differ in chain length (C7 -> C9). Comparing A→B reveals how increasing chain length at the 2‑position shifts perception (fish, cold, decayed, strength, pleasant, etc.).
2) Compute the A↔B midpoints to capture the chain‑length trend between those two 2‑ketones (this gives an averaged 2‑ketone baseline for the C8 series).
   - A (2‑heptanone) values and B (2‑nonanone) values yield the following midpoints for the core attributes used below (fish, cold, ammonia, decayed, strength, pleasant, familiar).
3) Now treat C (3‑octanone) as a known C8 ketone positional isomer. To estimate D (2‑octanone), apply the A→B chain‑length/2‑ketone trend to C by averaging C with the A↔B midpoint. In other words, 2‑octanone is predicted as the value halfway between the observed 3‑octanone and the averaged 2‑ketone baseline from A and B. This is the structural/odor analogy: the effect of being a 2‑ketone (in the C8 family) is approximated by the averaged 2‑ketone trend from related chain lengths, and the positional isomer (3‑octanone) pulls it toward known C8 behavior.
4) Where dataset columns existed (fish, cold, ammonia, decayed, strength, pleasant, familiar) those were computed numerically by that averaging method. For other sensory descriptors not present directly in the reference rows (edible, bakery, sweet, fruit, garlic, spices, sour, burnt, acid, warm, musky, sweaty, wood, grass, flower, chemical) I assigned values consistent with the same midline: medium pleasantness/strength typical of mid‑chain 2‑ketones, low sulfur/garlic, modest fruity/sweet notes, low musk/sweaty, and modest ""chemical"" character. All assigned values are constrained to the 0–100 scale and oriented to be consistent with the ketone family behavior observed in A, B and C.

Numeric example of the core calculation (illustrative):
 - 2‑heptanone (A) fish = 1.50 ; 2‑nonanone (B) fish = 6.67 ; midpoint = 4.08
 - 3‑octanone (C) fish = 2.50 ; average(C, midpoint) = (2.50 + 4.08)/2 = 3.29 → predicted fish for 2‑octanone
This averaging procedure was applied to the other measured attributes and guided assignment of the remaining descriptors.

Conclusion: predictions for 2‑octanone follow from the analogy A:2‑heptanone → B:2‑nonanone :: C:3‑octanone → D:2‑octanone using the averaged 2‑ketone trend blended with the known 3‑octanone values, with reasonable extrapolation for descriptors not directly available in the dataset.",45.0,20.0,38.0,30.0,3.29,2.0,12.0,30.94,13.0,6.0,12.0,33.0,10.0,8.0,21.31,22.18,18.0,18.0,22.0,28.0,51.6,53.39,46.59
Heptanoic Acid,"Analogy: Butyric acid (C4) is to Caproic acid (C6) as Caproic acid (C6) is to Heptanoic acid (C7). Reasoning steps: (1) Short saturated carboxylic acids (C4–C10) show systematic sensory trends as carbon chain increases: pungent, cheesy/sweaty/decayed notes and ammonia-like character tend to decrease with chain length, while fatty/soapy/waxy and milder rancid notes increase. (2) I use Caproic acid (hexanoic, C6) and Octanoic acid (C8) as nearby anchors: their reported ratings give a clear interpolation pattern (C6 values are stronger/pungent than C8). (3) Heptanoic acid (C7) should lie between C6 and C8 for most attributes (some perceptual qualities like ""acid"" and overall ""strength"" remain relatively high for mid chain acids). (4) For attributes not directly present in the provided dataset (edible, bakery, sweet, fruit, garlic, spices, sour, burnt, warm, musky, sweaty, wood, grass, flower, chemical) I extrapolate from typical carboxylic acid odor character: sour/acidic, rancid/cheesy/animalic, moderately strong, generally unpleasant and not floral/fruity/bakery. (5) Numeric values: interpolate between the C6 and C8 anchors where available (fish, cold, ammonia, decayed, strength, pleasant, familiar) and assign plausible values for the other descriptors consistent with known heptanoic/medium-chain acid odor (rancid/sweaty/acidic, low sweet/fruit/bakery).",22.0,6.0,8.0,6.0,18.7,5.0,12.0,29.7,45.0,4.0,70.0,30.0,12.0,38.0,26.7,31.8,10.0,12.0,5.0,20.0,67.8,23.7,47.4
hexanol,"Analogy used and reasoning steps:

Octanol is to heptanol as heptanol is to hexanol.  (A is to B as C is to D.)

Why this analogy: octanol (C8) → heptanol (C7) represents a one-carbon shortening in a homologous series of primary straight-chain alcohols. Sensory changes across one-carbon steps in this series are relatively smooth (small shifts in strength, pleasantness, and ‘‘green/grass’’ vs ‘‘fatty’’ character). To predict 1-hexanol (C6) I treat the heptanol profile as the midpoint reference and apply the same sort of one-carbon-step adjustments seen between octanol and heptanol, tempered by observed values for other primary alcohols (pentanol, hexanol isomers) in the dataset.

Concrete steps:
1. Start from heptanol (C7) sensory ratings (dataset entry) as the closest known homolog with a clean primary-alcohol odor profile.
2. Observe how octanol (C8) differs from heptanol: small changes in strength and pleasantness, higher ‘‘cold’’/smooth notes for longer chains, slightly lower ‘‘grass’’ and ‘‘ammonia’’ for the longer chain in that pair.
3. Apply the reverse trend (the one-carbon shortening effect) to go from heptanol (C7) → hexanol (C6): expect slightly more ‘‘green/grass’’ and slightly sharper/fresh aspects (higher ‘‘cold’’-type crispness less so than shorter alcohols), a modest change in ammonia/chemical edge, and a strength about the same or slightly lower. Also check 1-pentanol and isomeric hexanols in the dataset (2- and 3-hexanol entries) to avoid extreme values: these show moderate ‘‘green’’/‘‘grassy’’ and modest ammonia/fishy components, so 1-hexanol should be moderate in those dimensions.

Net inference: compared with heptanol, 1-hexanol is expected to be slightly greener/grassier, slightly sharper (a bit more ‘‘cold/fresh’’), with comparable strength, moderately pleasant and moderately familiar. Fish/garlic/rotten descriptors stay low. Values were set by anchoring to heptanol and adjusting modestly towards patterns seen for pentanol and other hexanol isomers in the dataset, producing a consistent homologous-series-based prediction.",25.0,10.0,15.0,10.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,30.0,12.0,5.0,10.0,35.0,12.0,10.0,28.0,20.0,25.0,55.0,20.0,30.0,53.0,48.0,46.0
propyl sulfide,"Diethyl sulfide (a small dialkyl thioether) is to ethyl-substitution as propyl sulfide is to propyl-substitution — i.e. treat propyl sulfide as the same thioether functional type as diethyl sulfide but with one-carbon-longer alkyl chains. Reasoning steps: (1) Use diethyl sulfide (CCSCC) as the nearest direct analogue in the provided dataset (entry: Diethyl sulfide) because both are simple symmetrical thioethers; use methyl sulfide and allyl/other sulfides (entries: Methyl sulfide, Allyl sulfide) to bound volatility and pungency. (2) Increasing alkyl chain length (ethyl -> propyl) typically lowers volatility and can slightly reduce sharp, volatile ""ammonia/green/cold"" impressions while keeping or modestly reducing overall perceived strength; it often shifts the odor toward heavier, more oily, cooked/onion/garlic-like sulphurous notes rather than extremely volatile, pungent notes. (3) Thiols and polysulfides are usually much stronger and more unpleasant than simple thioethers; propyl sulfide, as a thioether, should therefore be moderately strong but less extreme than thiols or disulfides. (4) Based on these analogues, adjust diethyl sulfide's profile: slightly lower ""cold"" and ""ammonia"" ratings, similar-to-slightly-lower overall strength, slightly higher ""garlic/alliaceous"" and ""decayed/rotten"" character than a simple alkane, and low ratings on fruity, floral, bakery and sweet axes. Predicted ratings are numerical adjustments from the diethyl/methyl/allyl sulfide examples, reflecting the one-carbon chain extension and typical perceptual trends for R–S–R thioethers.",18.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,20.0,45.0,18.0,25.0,8.0,12.0,10.0,22.0,10.0,20.0,25.0,30.0,8.0,5.0,4.0,55.0,45.0,30.0,40.0
Ethyl stearate,"Analogy: Short/medium-chain ethyl esters (A) are to high fruity/sweet and stronger odor profiles (B) as long-chain ethyl esters (C) are to weak, fatty/waxy profiles (D).

Reasoning steps used in the analogy: 
1) Identify A and B: Ethyl hexanoate / ethyl octanoate (A) are representative short–medium chain ethyl esters in the data that are rated high on fruit/sweet and have moderate-to-high strength and pleasantness (B). These show that shorter esters are volatile and perceived as fruity/sweet and strong. 
2) Identify C: Ethyl myristate and ethyl decanoate in the dataset show the trend: as the ester chain length increases (C), volatility and fruit/sweet character and perceived strength decrease while waxy/fatty/neutral notes increase. Ethyl myristate (C14) already has noticeably lower fruity/sweet intensity and lower pleasantness than octanoate. 
3) Map to D (ethly stearate): Ethyl stearate (very long C18 chain) will continue that trend: low volatility, very weak fruitiness/sweetness, low ‘‘sharp’’ notes (sour/burnt/ammonia), and a mild fatty/waxy, slightly edible/waxy impression. Strength, pleasantness and familiarity should be lower than for medium esters and comparable or slightly lower than ethyl myristate. 
4) Quantitative scaling: I scaled down fruit/sweet/strength from typical values for ethyl octanoate and ethyl decanoate using the observed decreases going to ethyl myristate, producing low fruit/sweet and low strength but modest edible/warm/waxy ratings for ethyl stearate.

Using this analogy and interpolation from ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate and ethyl myristate, the following numeric predictions were produced for ethyl stearate (0-100 scale).",30.0,18.0,8.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,18.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,22.0,18.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,15.0,8.0,6.0,10.0,25.0,34.0,40.0
Octane,"Analogy (A is to B as C is to D) and reasoning steps:

A = 1-octene (known proxy): 1-octene (SMILES CCCCCCC=C) has recorded scent ratings including strength ~37, pleasant ~43, familiar ~44, cold ~33, fish ~16.5, ammonia ~14.8. B = the known ratings of 1-octene. 

C = Octane (query): straight-chain C8 alkane (SMILES CCCCCCCC). D = predicted ratings for octane (what we want).

Analogy: 1-octene is to its known ratings (B) as octane is to its predicted ratings (D).

Why this analogy is appropriate and how it was used:
- 1-octene and octane share carbon chain length (C8) and similar volatility region; they differ mainly by a C=C double bond vs a saturated chain. In olfaction data, introducing unsaturation (double bonds) typically increases odor character intensity and often adds more ""chemical/unsaturated"" or sharper notes. Thus octane should be similar in qualitative profile to 1-octene but modestly reduced in intensity and with fewer ""sharp/chemical"" features. 
- To refine the estimate I also compared longer straight alkanes (e.g., undecane) which tend to be relatively neutral/waxy and sometimes rated moderately in strength/familiarity. Combining the two analogs: octane ~ same volatility region as 1-octene but somewhat less intense/sharp; ~similar neutrality/waxiness to undecane but slightly more volatile and noticeable than long-chain alkanes.

Concrete adjustment rules applied to map from the analogs to octane predictions:
1) Strength: take 1-octene's moderate strength (~37) and reduce slightly due to saturation -> predicted strength ~35.  
2) ""Chemical"" character: unsaturation increases ""chemical"" perception, so octane's chemical rating is lower than 1-octene but still moderate because hydrocarbons are perceived as ""chemical/petroleum"" -> chemical ~50. 
3) Pleasant/familiar: straight alkanes are relatively neutral-to-slightly unpleasant/neutral; 1-octene's pleasant ~43, so octane slightly less pleasant (more neutral) ~35 and familiar ~45. 
4) Specific descriptors (fruit, bakery, sweet, flower, fish, garlic, spices, sour, acid, sweaty, ammonia, decayed): most are negligible for nonpolar alkanes. Use low values (near zero to low teens) except for attributes like ""cold"" or ""warm"" which often get mid-range ratings for hydrocarbons. 
5) Musky/wood/grass: small-to-moderate low values because octane can smell paraffinic/oily but not strongly floral/green. 

These adjustments, anchored to the A:B :: C:D analogy and cross-checked with similar straight-chain alkane entries (longer chains) and C8-unsaturated entries, give the numeric predictions below.",5.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,30.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,20.0,12.0,5.0,15.0,15.0,12.0,6.0,4.0,50.0,35.0,35.0,45.0
1-Octene,"Analogy: Octane : (octane's odor profile) :: 1-Octene : (1-octene's odor profile). Reasoning steps: 
1) Identify a close structural analogue in the dataset: octane (straight-chain C8 hydrocarbon) is present and has a weak-to-moderate hydrocarbon/petroleum odor (strength ≈49, pleasant ≈51). 
2) Examine how introducing a terminal double bond (alkene) typically shifts odor in nearby examples: unsaturated analogues or terminal alkenes often smell a bit sharper/""chemical"" and sometimes a touch greener. For example, unsaturated C8 alcohols (1-octen-3-ol, trans-2-octen-1-ol) show comparable strength but tend to be less universally ""pleasant"" and carry mushroom/green/earthy or sharp notes; purely hydrocarbon unsaturates (simple alkenes) typically increase the ""chemical"" character without adding fruity/bakery edibility. 
3) Combine these observations: 1-octene should be close to octane in baseline intensity and lack of fruit/bakery/flower edibility, but shifted toward higher ""chemical"" and slightly more green/grass-like notes, with low edible/sweet/spicy/garlic character. Strength remains moderate; pleasantness slightly lower than octane. 
4) Produce numeric predictions by taking octane-like baseline and applying the expected shifts (increase chemical & grass, decrease edible/pleasant).",5.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,25.0,20.0,30.0,8.0,35.0,8.0,5.0,22.0,28.0,18.0,22.0,8.0,55.0,48.0,45.0,40.0
heptanol,"Hexanol is to octanol as heptanol is to D. Reasoning: Hexanol (1-hexanol, C6) and 1-octanol (C8) are homologous primary alcohols that differ only by a -CH2- unit; their odor impressions shift smoothly with chain length. To predict 1-heptanol (C7) I treat it as the midpoint between hexanol and octanol and adjust where known homolog trends skew (e.g., longer chains often feel slightly less “green/leafy” and a bit more hydrophobic/woody, with overall odor strength roughly stable or slightly increasing). I therefore interpolate attributes measured for hexanol and octanol (and check nonanol as a sanity check) and adjust for typical primary-alcohol character (low sulfur/garlic, low ammonia, moderate fatty/green/woody). Stepwise: (1) start with hexanol and octanol values and take the midpoint for most sensory axes; (2) nudge “pleasant” slightly toward hexanol (shorter alcohols often read slightly fresher/pleasant) and “cold”/“ammonia” toward octanol (octanol showed higher cold/ammonia ratings); (3) set sulfur/garlic/ammonia-sour-burnt attributes very low because primary aliphatic alcohols rarely smell like garlic or burnt; (4) assign moderate “wood/grass/flower” for a linear C7 alcohol (green/herbaceous and faint woody notes are common). The numeric predictions below are the interpolated/adjusted estimates for 1‑heptanol (0–100 scale).",35.0,10.0,30.0,20.0,6.0,1.0,10.0,26.0,12.0,8.0,10.0,40.0,20.0,10.0,27.0,25.0,30.0,35.0,25.0,22.0,50.0,52.0,50.0
Hexyl octanoate,"Analogy used to derive predictions:
A is to B as C is to D
A = Hexyl hexanoate (known reference ester: hexyl + hexanoate)
B = observed scent profile of Hexyl hexanoate (moderately fruity/pleasant, moderate strength, low off-notes)
C = Hexyl octanoate (target molecule: hexyl + octanoate; same alcohol part, acid chain two carbons longer)
D = predicted scent profile for Hexyl octanoate

Reasoning steps:
1) Structural analogy: both A and C are esters with the same hexyl alcohol moiety; they differ only in acid-chain length (hexanoate C6 vs octanoate C8). This is a conservative structural change expected to alter volatility and ""fatty/waxy"" character more than fundamental odor quality.
2) Observed pattern in dataset: increasing alkyl chain length on the acid side typically lowers volatility (reduced ""cold/green/volatile"" impressions), slightly shifts perception from sharp, bright fruity notes toward rounder, waxy/fatty and slightly less volatile fruitiness, and often keeps pleasantness moderate-to-high while sometimes lowering ""familiar"" or fruity intensity. Strength (overall intensity) often remains in the mid range or increases slightly with chain length due to lower vapor pressure but longer persistence.
3) Using Hexyl hexanoate (entry 352: strength ~54, pleasant ~45.6, familiar ~38.6) and comparing to other longer acid esters (e.g., ethyl octanoate/decanoate, isoamyl octanoate), we predict hexyl octanoate will be similarly fruity/sweet but a bit less volatile, slightly waxier/rounder, with low off-notes (fish, garlic, ammonia, sweaty, burnt) and moderate strength/pleasantness.
4) Translate these qualitative adjustments into numeric ratings (0-100): favoring medium-high edible/fruit/sweet ratings, low rotten/garlic/ammonia/fishy ratings, modest bakery/flower/wood components, and strength/pleasant/familiar in the 40-60 range consistent with analogous esters.

Predicted numeric values reflect the above mapping from A->B to C->D, applying modest adjustments for the two-carbon longer acid chain (slightly more waxy/round, slightly lower volatility).",62.0,25.0,58.0,62.0,4.0,1.0,8.0,18.0,12.0,1.0,18.0,38.0,18.0,3.0,3.0,8.0,22.0,12.0,28.0,20.0,53.0,50.0,42.0
Methyl trans-2-nonenoate,"A is to B as C is to D.

A = methyl nonanoate (saturated C9 methyl ester). B = the known perceptual profile for methyl nonanoate (moderately fruity, moderately pleasant, moderate strength; cold/green/off-notes modest).

C = methyl trans-2-nonenoate (same carbon length and ester functionality as A, but with a trans-2 double bond). D = predicted perceptual profile for methyl trans-2-nonenoate.

Reasoning steps (how the analogy was applied):
1) Structural analogy: methyl trans-2-nonenoate differs from methyl nonanoate only by a C2–C3 trans double bond (unsaturation close to the ester group). Because the backbone length and ester headgroup are the same, many baseline characteristics (fruity, ester-like, moderately pleasant, familiar) will be similar to methyl nonanoate.
2) Modifying effect of the trans-2 unsaturation: unsaturation at the 2-position (especially trans configuration) commonly shifts an ester toward a greener/leafy/‘green-fruity’ character, can raise perceived odor strength (more volatile/impactful at the olfactory receptors) and slightly increase a ‘chemical/unsaturated’ or ‘grass’ quality relative to the saturated analogue. This is seen in related examples: methyl 2-nonynoate (triple bond at 2) is stronger than methyl nonanoate; trans-2-hexenyl derivatives show increased green/leafy (grass) character vs saturated analogues.
3) Quantitative adjustments from B to D: start from methyl nonanoate baseline (B) and (a) increase strength by a moderate amount (unsaturation near the ester increases perceptual intensity), (b) increase grass/green and chemical attributes, (c) slightly reduce pure ‘sweet/fruity’ and ‘bakery’ impressions because the unsaturation shifts the balance away from a pure sugary-fruity ester odor, (d) keep fish/garlic/sweaty/ammonia/decayed low (esters of this class are not typically fishy or sulfurous), (e) keep pleasantness broadly similar to slightly above/below baseline depending on whether the green note is perceived as pleasant — here I predict a slight net retention of pleasantness (still moderately pleasant) because many trans-2-ester notes are judged pleasant in flavor/fragrance contexts.
4) Calibration with nearby examples: methyl nonanoate (dataset) has moderate strength (~46), pleasant (~58), familiar (~49). Methyl 2-nonynoate (dataset) shows a stronger, slightly more characterful profile (strength ~63, pleasant ~62). trans-2-hexenyl acetate (green-green ester) shows increased ‘cold/green’ and grass attributes but moderate strength. Taken together, a reasonable prediction is that methyl trans-2-nonenoate will be similar to methyl nonanoate but somewhat stronger and greener, with fruitiness still present but a touch muted.

Numeric adjustments applied explicitly:
- Base fruit/sweet/edible from methyl nonanoate-like ester: fruit high/moderate. Reduce fruit slightly to account for green unsaturated note.
- Strength: increase by ~8–12 points from the saturated analogue.
- Grass/cold/chemical: increase moderately vs saturated analogue.
- Fish/garlic/spices/musky/sweaty/ammonia/decayed: remain low.

These steps yield the predicted numeric profile for methyl trans-2-nonenoate below.",40.0,20.0,45.0,55.0,6.0,5.0,10.0,36.0,18.0,10.0,20.0,30.0,12.0,8.0,16.0,18.0,15.0,45.0,25.0,30.0,55.0,58.0,50.0
Methyl 2-nonynoate,"Methyl nonanoate is to methyl trans-2-nonenoate as methyl trans-2-nonenoate is to methyl 2-nonynoate.

Reasoning steps:
1) Identify A and B and measured change: Methyl nonanoate (a saturated C9 methyl ester; entry 202) -> methyl trans-2-nonenoate (an α,β-unsaturated C9 methyl ester; entry 95). Going from the saturated ester to the α,β-unsaturated ester in the dataset produces a modest drop in perceived pleasantness/familiarity and a modest change in “strength” and fruitiness — the unsaturation near the carbonyl tends to make the odor a touch sharper/less smoothly fruity while keeping it recognizably ester-like.
2) Apply the same directional change for C -> D: here C is methyl trans-2-nonenoate and D is methyl 2-nonynoate (the corresponding α-alkynyl ester). An alkynyl substitution adjacent to the ester carbonyl generally keeps the ester (fruity) character but often makes the scent slightly sharper/‘‘chemical’’ and a bit less sweet/juicy than the corresponding alkene; familiar/pleasant ratings usually decline slightly relative to the alkene, and the ‘‘chemical’’ and ‘‘cold/sharp’’ facets increase a bit.
3) Quantitative translation: starting from the alkene (methyl trans-2-nonenoate) as a baseline, I reduce fruit/sweet/edible/bakery attributes modestly, slightly lower pleasantness and familiarity, keep the odor strength in the mild-to-moderate range, increase the ‘‘chemical’’ adjective and slightly increase cold/sharp sensations, and keep malodorous descriptors (fish, garlic, ammonia, sweaty, decayed) low because esters are not strongly sulfurous or fecal. Wood/grass/flower are given low-to-moderate values consistent with a fruity ester with some floral/green top-notes.
4) Final predicted profile reflects an ester that is still predominantly fruity/sweet/edible but a touch sharper and less smooth than the saturated ester — consistent with an α-alkynyl methyl ester.

(Values adjusted qualitatively based on observed differences between methyl nonanoate and methyl trans-2-nonenoate and known effects of replacing an alkene with an alkyne adjacent to an ester.)",50.0,25.0,57.0,65.0,6.0,2.0,12.0,28.0,8.0,5.0,14.0,34.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,12.0,12.0,18.0,38.0,30.0,35.0,50.0,44.0
octanol,"Analogy used: Hexanol : Hexanol_ratings :: Octanol : Octanol_predictions.
Reasoning steps:
1) Identify close structural analogs in the dataset: straight-chain primary alcohols of similar chain length (hexanol C6, heptanol C7, nonanol C9, decanol C10). These share the same functional group (primary alcohol) and differ mainly by alkyl chain length.
2) Use the analogs' sensory profiles as the basis. Primary straight-chain alcohols in the data show consistent patterns: moderate-to-moderately-high odor strength (~48–53), moderate pleasantness (~40–55) and familiarity (~40–55); low-to-moderate ""fishy""/""ammonia"" character that tends to rise slightly with chain length; ""decayed"" and ""cold"" descriptors vary but are near mid-range for C6–C10.
3) Because octanol (C8) sits between C7 and C9, take an average of the C6, C7, C9 and C10 values (weighted evenly) as a reasonable estimate and slightly adjust where chain-length trends are evident (e.g., small increase in ""fish"" and ""cold"" with length, small decrease in ""pleasant"" with very long chains).
4) Map averaged and adjusted values to each requested descriptor. For descriptors not explicitly listed for every analog (edible, bakery, sweet, fruit, garlic, spices, sour, burnt, acid, warm, musky, sweaty, wood, grass, flower, chemical) use typical qualitative behavior of straight-chain primary alcohols (fatty/waxy/alcoholic: low fruit/sweet/bakery; low garlic/spices; modest warm/woody/chemical/musky notes) and scale them consistently with the averaged strength/pleasantness.
5) Final predictions are numeric (0–100) and reflect the averaged/adjusted profile: octanol is expected to be a moderately strong, moderately pleasant, moderately familiar, slightly fatty/waxy primary alcohol with modest ""cold"" and mild ""decayed""/""ammonia"" facets but low fruity/sweet/bakery and low garlic/spicy characters.",30.0,15.0,20.0,12.0,11.44,5.0,10.0,25.05,8.0,6.0,10.0,30.0,18.0,12.0,26.06,26.45,22.0,20.0,18.0,35.0,51.31,47.24,47.24
undecane,"Analogy: Octane is to its measured scent profile as Undecane is to the predicted scent profile. Reasoning steps: 
1) Identify A and B: Octane (A) has an empirical scent profile in the dataset (B): a mild, low-fruit, slightly petrochemical odor with moderate strength (Octane: strength ~48.9, pleasant ~51.1) and low 'fish/garlic/fruit' character. 
2) Map structural change: Undecane (C) is the next higher linear n-alkane (one extra CH2) relative to octane. In olfaction of straight-chain alkanes, increasing chain length (while keeping straight-chain, no polar functionality) reduces volatility and vapor concentration at equal temperature/conditions, which typically lowers perceived intensity and some sharper top-note characters while preserving the general hydrocarbon/petroleum-like character. 
3) Use dataset analogs: related entries (e.g., Octane, longer neutral hydrocarbons and long-chain alcohols/aldehydes in the table) show that adding mass and polarity can increase intensity only if functionality is introduced (alcohols, aldehydes are stronger). For straight alkanes, the trend is toward somewhat lower strength and slightly more “waxy/chemical” and less sharp/fruity notes with increasing chain length. 
4) Transfer the pattern: therefore undecane’s profile should be similar to octane’s but shifted toward slightly lower strength, marginally less “cold/volatile” top-note character, slightly more waxy/chemical/warm impression, and generally very low edible/bakery/sweet/fruit/garlic/fish/spice scores. 
5) Quantitative scaling: I started from Octane’s empirical anchors (strength ~49, pleasant ~51, cold ~24) and applied a modest downward adjustment to strength and cold/volatile descriptors (–~7–10%), left low categories near zero, and kept chemical/waxy/musky modestly present. The resulting numeric predictions below follow these adjustments and the qualitative rationale above.",2.0,1.0,1.5,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,22.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,18.0,12.0,2.0,18.0,28.0,6.0,4.0,2.0,35.0,40.5,48.0,42.0
heptyl acetate,"Hexyl acetate (A) is to Nonyl acetate (B) as Heptyl acetate (C) is to D (the target). Reasoning: Hexyl acetate (A, C6 alkyl acetate) is a prototypical fruity, sweet acetate with moderate strength, low fish/garlic/ammonia, and fairly high pleasant/familiar ratings. Nonyl acetate (B, C9 alkyl acetate) is a longer-chain acetate that in the dataset shows a shift toward slightly less pure fruity character and somewhat altered strength/pleasantness (more fatty/waxy/less fruity in some measures). By analogy, Heptyl acetate (C, C7 alkyl acetate) should sit between these two examples in properties: it will keep the characteristic fruity/sweet/edible ester profile of hexyl acetate but be slightly shifted toward the fuller, fatter/less-volatile character of nonyl acetate. I also compared to the corresponding alcohol (heptanol) and other heptyl/ester examples (e.g., ethyl heptanoate, 3-octyl acetate) — esters are consistently more fruity/sweet and rated more pleasant than the parent alcohols. Thus I interpolated key numeric descriptors between hexyl and nonyl acetates, adjusted for typical ester-vs-alcohol shifts (increase in fruit/sweet/pleasant relative to the alcohol), and constrained off-notes (fish, garlic, ammonia, decayed) to remain low-moderate. The listed numeric predictions are the result of that interpolation and domain knowledge about chain-length effects on acetate esters (longer chains → slightly waxy/fatty, slightly lower volatility, modest change in pleasantness).",55.0,15.0,55.0,65.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,31.2,18.0,5.0,20.0,30.0,10.0,8.0,23.8,25.4,12.0,20.0,25.0,15.0,54.2,55.0,48.0
