I will also consider the ratings of similar compounds such as hexanal and heptanal, which are known to have green, fatty, or waxy scents. Given that valeraldehyde is in the middle range of these compounds, I expect its ratings to reflect a balance between pleasant and pungent characteristics, leaning towards a mild, sweet scent due to its relatively short chain.",60.0,55.0,65.0,50.0,10.0,5.0,20.0,30.0,15.0,5.0,10.0,40.0,15.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,20.0,25.0,30.0,10.0,50.0,60.0,55.0
Diethyl disulfide,"To predict the scent perception ratings for Diethyl disulfide, I will analyze its molecular structure and compare it to similar compounds in the dataset. Diethyl disulfide has a structure that includes two ethyl groups attached to a disulfide (S-S) bond. This structure is similar to other sulfur-containing compounds, such as dimethyl sulfide and other thioethers, which often have strong, pungent odors. I will look at the ratings of similar sulfur compounds in the dataset to infer the expected ratings for Diethyl disulfide. For example, compounds like dimethyl sulfide and other thioethers typically have high ratings for 'fish' and 'sweaty' due to their sulfur content. I will also consider the presence of ethyl groups, which can add a slightly sweet or fruity note, potentially affecting the 'sweet' and 'pleasant' ratings. Based on these comparisons, I will assign ratings for various scent aspects.",10.0,5.0,15.0,10.0,70.0,60.0,30.0,20.0,15.0,10.0,5.0,25.0,20.0,80.0,5.0,30.0,10.0,5.0,5.0,60.0,75.0,20.0,15.0
Cyclohexane,"Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a cyclic alkane with a simple structure that lacks functional groups typically associated with strong odors. To predict its scent perception ratings, I will compare it to other aliphatic hydrocarbons and cyclic compounds in the dataset. Aliphatic hydrocarbons like octane and hexane generally have low odor intensity and are often perceived as neutral or slightly pleasant. Cyclohexane, being a cyclic version of these aliphatic compounds, is expected to have similar characteristics. I will also consider the ratings of other cyclic compounds in the dataset, such as cyclohexanone and cyclopentanone, which have slightly more complex structures and functional groups that contribute to their scent. However, since cyclohexane is a saturated hydrocarbon, it is likely to have low ratings for strength, pleasantness, and familiarity, similar to other simple hydrocarbons. Therefore, I will assign low ratings for strength and pleasantness, moderate ratings for familiar and neutral aspects, and very low ratings for pungent or unpleasant odors like ammonia or decayed.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,20.0,15.0
pyridine,"Pyridine is a six-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen atom, which gives it a distinct scent profile. To predict its scent perception ratings, I will compare it to structurally similar compounds such as aniline and other nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds. Aniline has a somewhat sweet and amine-like odor, while pyridine is known for its more pungent, fishy, and somewhat unpleasant smell. I will analyze the ratings of similar compounds to estimate pyridine's ratings. For example, compounds like 2-methylpyridine and 3-methylpyridine have been noted for their strong, somewhat unpleasant odors, which can be extrapolated to pyridine. I will also consider the presence of nitrogen in the structure, which often correlates with stronger, more pungent odors. Based on these comparisons, I will assign ratings for various scent aspects such as fishy, cold, ammonia, and pleasantness.",5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,40.0,10.0,15.0,20.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,30.0,15.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,40.0,70.0,10.0,20.0
Piperidine,"Piperidine is a six-membered saturated heterocyclic compound containing one nitrogen atom. To predict its scent perception ratings, I will compare it to structurally similar compounds, particularly those with similar nitrogen-containing structures. For instance, I will look at the scent profiles of other nitrogen-containing compounds such as pyridine and piperidine derivatives. These compounds often exhibit earthy, musty, or slightly sweet notes due to their nitrogen content. Additionally, I will consider the presence of functional groups that may influence the scent, such as alkyl chains or aromatic rings. Based on the patterns observed in the data, I will assign ratings for various scent aspects, considering that piperidine is likely to have a moderate to strong scent due to its nitrogen content and cyclic structure.",30.0,20.0,25.0,15.0,10.0,5.0,20.0,15.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,20.0,30.0,25.0,40.0,15.0,10.0,20.0,5.0,35.0,60.0,25.0,30.0

I will look for compounds with similar carbon chain lengths and functional groups to draw parallels in scent perception. For instance, compounds like 3-Octanone and 2-Nonanone have similar structures and can provide insight into the expected scent profile. I will also consider the presence of methyl groups, which can influence the scent to be more fruity or floral. Based on these comparisons, I will estimate the ratings for various scent aspects such as 'sweet', 'fruit', 'warm', and 'pleasant'.",30.0,20.0,40.0,50.0,10.0,5.0,15.0,25.0,10.0,5.0,20.0,45.0,15.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,20.0,30.0,15.0,60.0,55.0,50.0

I will look at the ratings of other esters, particularly those with similar carbon chain lengths and functional groups. For instance, Methyl caprylate is similar to Methyl caprate (C10H20O2) and Methyl hexanoate (C8H16O2), which have fruity and sweet notes. Based on the ratings of these compounds, I will estimate the ratings for Methyl caprylate. I expect it to have a moderate to high sweetness rating due to its ester nature, a fruity rating due to its carbon chain length, and a pleasant overall scent. I will also consider that it may have lower ratings for aspects like fish, ammonia, and burnt, as these are not typical for esters. Therefore, I will assign ratings based on these comparisons and the general characteristics of similar esters.",70.0,30.0,80.0,75.0,5.0,5.0,20.0,10.0,15.0,5.0,20.0,30.0,10.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,15.0,20.0,25.0,10.0,60.0,75.0,70.0
2-octanone,"To predict the scent perception ratings for 2-octanone, I will analyze its molecular structure and compare it to similar compounds in the dataset. 2-octanone has a carbon chain length of 8, which is similar to other ketones and esters in the dataset. I will look at the ratings of other octanones and related compounds to establish a pattern. For example, I will consider the ratings of 3-octanone and 4-octanone, which have similar carbon chain lengths and functional groups. Additionally, I will consider the presence of functional groups such as ketones, which often have a sweet or fruity scent. Based on the average ratings of similar compounds, I will estimate the ratings for 2-octanone.",30.0,25.0,35.0,20.0,5.0,10.0,15.0,20.0,10.0,5.0,15.0,25.0,10.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,15.0,20.0,10.0,15.0,30.0,50.0,40.0
Heptanoic Acid,"Heptanoic acid (C7H14O2) is a straight-chain fatty acid, similar to other fatty acids like octanoic acid (C8H16O2) and hexanoic acid (C6H12O2). Fatty acids typically have a waxy or oily scent, often described as rancid or unpleasant. By examining the scent ratings of structurally similar fatty acids, we can predict the scent profile of heptanoic acid. For instance, octanoic acid has a strong rancid smell, while hexanoic acid has a slightly less intense rancid odor. Given that heptanoic acid is in between these two in terms of carbon chain length, we can infer that its scent will also be in between these two, likely leaning towards a rancid or fatty odor. Therefore, I predict the ratings for 'edible' and 'pleasant' will be low, while 'strength' will be moderate to high due to the nature of fatty acids. The other aspects like 'sour', 'sweet', and 'chemical' will also be low, as they do not typically characterize fatty acids.",10.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,7.0,5.0,4.0
hexanol,"Hexanol is a straight-chain alcohol with a relatively simple structure, similar to other alcohols and aliphatic compounds. To predict its scent perception ratings, I will compare it to structurally similar compounds such as 1-octanol and 2-pentanol, which have known scent profiles. Both of these compounds are also alcohols and have similar carbon chain lengths. 1-octanol is known for its fatty, waxy scent, while 2-pentanol has a more floral and sweet aroma. Given that hexanol has a similar structure to these compounds, I can infer that its scent will likely fall between these two profiles. I will also consider the ratings of other alcohols and their typical scent characteristics, such as pleasantness and strength. Based on this reasoning, I predict hexanol will have moderate ratings for pleasantness and strength, with a slightly sweet and floral scent profile.",30.0,20.0,40.0,25.0,15.0,10.0,20.0,30.0,15.0,5.0,20.0,25.0,10.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,20.0,35.0,40.0,15.0,50.0,60.0,55.0
propyl sulfide,"To predict the scent perception ratings for propyl sulfide, I will analyze its molecular structure and compare it to similar compounds with known scent profiles. Propyl sulfide (C3H8S) contains a sulfur atom, which is often associated with strong, pungent odors. I will look at other sulfur-containing compounds in the dataset, such as dimethyl sulfide and thiophenol, which have strong and often unpleasant odors. Additionally, I will consider the carbon chain length and branching, as these factors can influence the scent. For example, longer carbon chains in sulfur compounds tend to have more complex odors, while shorter chains may have more straightforward, pungent scents. Based on these comparisons, I will assign ratings for various scent aspects, focusing on the pungency and potential unpleasantness of the sulfur component.",5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,30.0,40.0,10.0,15.0,20.0,5.0,10.0,5.0,5.0,25.0,30.0,35.0,5.0,10.0,2.0,50.0,70.0,10.0,15.0
Ethyl stearate,"Ethyl stearate is an ester formed from stearic acid and ethanol. Esters are generally associated with fruity and sweet scents, often reminiscent of various fruits and flowers. To predict the scent perception ratings for ethyl stearate, I will look at structurally similar esters and their scent profiles. For example, esters like ethyl acetate and butyl acetate are known for their sweet and fruity aromas. Given that ethyl stearate has a longer carbon chain, it may lean towards a more creamy or fatty scent, but still retain some sweetness. I will assign higher ratings for 'sweet' and 'edible' aspects, moderate ratings for 'bakery' and 'fruit', and lower ratings for 'fish', 'garlic', and 'chemical' aspects, as these are not typically associated with esters. Overall, I expect ethyl stearate to have a pleasant and familiar scent profile, with a warm and creamy undertone.",70.0,60.0,75.0,65.0,10.0,5.0,20.0,15.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,70.0,20.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,15.0,20.0,60.0,5.0,60.0,75.0,70.0

Hexanol has a sweet and grassy scent, while octanol is often described as having a fatty, waxy odor. Given that heptanol is in between these two in terms of carbon chain length, I expect its scent to be a blend of these characteristics. I will also consider the general trend that longer carbon chains in alcohols tend to have more complex and pleasant scents. Therefore, I predict heptanol will have moderate ratings for pleasantness and sweetness, and lower ratings for sourness and fishiness, as these are not typical for alcohols. Additionally, I will rate it low on burnt and chemical aspects, as these are not common for straight-chain alcohols.",60.0,30.0,65.0,40.0,5.0,10.0,20.0,15.0,10.0,5.0,10.0,50.0,20.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,30.0,55.0,40.0,5.0,50.0,70.0,60.0

Alkanes generally have low odor intensity and are often perceived as neutral or slightly waxy. To predict the scent perception ratings for undecane, I will compare it to other straight-chain alkanes and their associated scent profiles. For example, hexane and octane are known to have mild, somewhat pleasant scents, often described as waxy or oily. Given that undecane is longer than these compounds, it may have a slightly stronger scent but still remain in the low-intensity range. I will assign ratings based on this reasoning, considering that undecane is likely to be perceived as less pleasant than more aromatic compounds but still not offensive. Therefore, I will predict low ratings for strength and pleasantness, moderate ratings for familiarity, and low ratings for other specific scent categories like sweet, fruity, or floral.",10.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,15.0,10.0,20.0
